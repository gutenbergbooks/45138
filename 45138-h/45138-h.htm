<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> writer of this trifling Volume was suddenly sentenced, in the
cold evening of his life, to drink the mineral waters of one of the
bubbling springs, or brunnens, of Nassau. In his own opinion, his
constitution was not worth so troublesome a repair; but, being outvoted,
he bowed and departed.</p>

<p>On reaching the point of his destination, he found not only
water-bibbing&mdash;bathing&mdash;and ambulation to be the orders of the
day, but it was moreover insisted upon, that the mind was to be
relaxed inversely as the body was to be strengthened. During this
severe regimen, he was driven to amuse himself in his old age by
blowing, as he toddled about, a few literary Bubbles. His hasty
sketches of whatever chanced for the moment to please either his
eyes, or his mind, were only made&mdash;<i>because he had nothing else
in the whole world to do</i>; and he now offers them to that vast and
highly respectable class of people who read from exactly the self-same
motive.</p>

<p>The critic must, of course, declare this production to be vain&mdash;empty&mdash;light&mdash;hollow&mdash;superficial ...... but
it is the nature
of Bubbles to be so.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_VOYAGE" id="THE_VOYAGE">THE VOYAGE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the time I reached the Custom-house Stairs, the paddles of
the Rotterdam steam-boat were actually in motion, and I had
scarcely hurried across a plank, when I heard it fall splash into the
muddy water which separated me farther and farther from the
wharf. Still later than myself, passengers were now seen chasing
the vessel in boats, and there was a confusion on deck, which I
gladly availed myself of, by securing, close to the helmsman, a corner,
where, muffled in the ample folds of an old boat-cloak, I felt I
might quietly enjoy an incognito; for, as the sole object of my expedition
was to do myself as much good and as little harm as possible,
I considered it would be a pity to wear out my constitution
by any travelling exclamations in the Thames.</p>

<p>The hatches being now opened, the huge pile of trunks, black
portmanteaus, and gaudy carpet-bags which had threatened at first
to obstruct my prospect was rapidly stowed away; and, as the vessel,
hissing and smoking, glided, or rather scuffled, by Deptford,
Greenwich, Woolwich, &amp;c., a very motley group of fellow-passengers
were all occupied in making remarks of more or less importance.
Some justly prided themselves on being able to read aloud
inscriptions on shore, which others had declared, from their immense
distance, to be illegible;&mdash;some, bending forward, modestly
asked for information; some, standing particularly upright, pompously,
imparted it; at times, wondering eyes, both male and female,
were seen radiating in all directions; then all were concentrated
on an approaching sister steam-boat, which, steering an
opposite course, soon rapidly passed us; the gilt figure at her
head, the splashing of the paddles, and the name written over her
stern, occasioning observations which burst into existence nearly
as simultaneously as the thunder and lightning of heaven;&mdash;handkerchiefs
were waved, and bipeds of both sexes seemed to be delighted,
save and except one mild, gloomy, inquisitive little man,
who went bleating like a lamb from one fellow-passenger to another,
without getting even from me any answer to his harmless
question, &ldquo;whether we had or had not passed yet the men hanging
in chains?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as we got below Gravesend, the small volume of life
which, with feelings of good-fellowship to all men, I had thus been
calmly reviewing, began to assume a graver tone; and, as page
after page presented itself to my notice, I observed that notes of
interrogation and marks of admiration were types not so often to be
met with, as the comma, the colon&mdash;and, above all&mdash;the full stop.</p>

<p>The wind, as it freshened with the sun, seemed to check all exuberance
of fancy; and, as the puny river-wave rose, conversation
around me lulled and lulled into a dead calm. A few people, particularly
some ladies, suddenly at last broke silence, giving utterance
to a mass of heavy matter-of-fact ejaculations, directed rather to
fishes than to men. Certain colours in the picture now began rapidly
to alter&mdash;the red rose gradually looked like the lily&mdash;brown
skin changed itself into dirty yellow, and I observed two heavy
cheeks of warm, comfortable, fat flesh gradually assume the appearance
of cold wrinkled tallow. Off Margate, a sort of hole-and-corner
system very soon began to prevail, and one human being
after another slowly descending heels foremost, vanished from deck
into a sub-stratum, or infernal region, where there was moaning,
and groaning, and gnashing of teeth; and, as head after head thus
solemnly sunk from my view, I gradually threw aside the folds of
my ægis, until finding myself alone, I hailed and inhaled with pleasure
the cool fresh breeze which had thus caused me to be left, as
I wished to be, by myself.</p>

<p>The gale now delightfully increased&mdash;(ages ago I had been too
often exposed to it to suffer from its effect);&mdash;and, as wave after
wave became tipt with white, there flitted before my mind a hundred
recollections chasing one another, which I never thought to
have re-enjoyed; occasionally they were interrupted by the salt
spray, and as it dashed into my face, I felt my grizzled eyebrows
curl themselves up, as if they wished me once again to view the
world in the prismatic colours of &ldquo;Auld Lang Syne.&rdquo; Already was
my cure half effected; and the soot of London being thus washed
from my brow, I felt a reanimation of mind and a vigour of frame
which made me long for the moment when, like the sun bursting
from behind a cloud, I might cast aside my shadowy mantle: however,
I never moved from my nook, until the darkness of night at
last encouraging me, without fear of observation, to walk the deck,
&ldquo;I paced along upon the giddy footing of the hatches,&rdquo; till tired of
these vibrations, I stood for a few moments at the gangway.</p>

<p>There was no moon&mdash;a star only here and there was to be seen;
yet, as the fire-propelled vessel cut her way, the paddles, by
shivering in succession each wave to atoms, produced a phosphoric
sparkling, resembling immense lanthorns at her side; and
while these beacons distinctly proclaimed where the vessel actually was,
a pale shining stream of light issued from her keel,
which, for a ship&rsquo;s length or two, told fainter and fainter where
she <i>had been</i>.</p>

<p>The ideas which rush into the mind, on contemplating by night,
out of sight of land, the sea, are as dark, as mysterious, as unfathomable,
and as indescribable as the vast ocean itself. One sees but
little,&mdash;yet that little, caught here and there, so much resembles
some of the attributes of the Great Power which created us, that the
mind, trembling under the immensity of the conceptions it engenders,
is lost in feelings which human beings cannot impart to each
other. In the hurricane which one meets with in southern latitudes,
most of us have probably looked in vain for the waves
which have been described to be &ldquo;mountain high;&rdquo; but, though
the outline has been exaggerated, is there not a terror in the filling
in of the picture which no human artist can delineate? and in the
raging of the tempest&mdash;in the darkness which the lightning makes
visible&mdash;who is there among us that has not fancied he has caught
a shadow of the wrath, and a momentary glimmering of the
mercy, of the Almighty?</p>

<p>Impressed with these hackneyed feelings, I slowly returned to
my nook, and all being obscure, except just the red, rough countenance
of the helmsman, feebly illuminated by the light in the
binnacle, I laid myself down, and sometimes nodding a little and
sometimes dozing, I enjoyed for many hours a sort of half sleep,
of which I stood in no little need.</p>

<p>As soon as we had crossed the Briell, the vessel being at once
in smooth water, the passengers successively emerged from their
graves below, until, in a couple of hours, their ghastly countenances
all were on deck.</p>

<p>A bell, as if in hysterics, now rang most violently, as a signal to
the town of Rotterdam. The word of command, &ldquo;STOP HER!&rdquo;
was loudly vociferated by a bluff, short, Dirk Hatteraick-looking
pilot, who had come on board off the Briell. &ldquo;Stop her!&rdquo; was
just heard faintly echoed from below, by the invisible exhausted
sallow being who had had, during the voyage, charge of the engine.
The paddles, in obedience to the mandate, ceased&mdash;then
gave two turns&mdash;ceased,&mdash;turned once again&mdash;paused,&mdash;gave one
last struggle, when, our voyage being over, the vessel&rsquo;s side
slightly bumped against the pier.</p>

<p>With a noise like one of Congreve&rsquo;s rockets, the now useless
steam was immediately exploded by the pale being below, and, in
a few seconds, half the passengers were seen on shore, hurrying in
different directions about a town full of canals and spirit shops.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Compared with Greece and Italy&mdash;Holland is but a platter-faced,
cold-gin-and-water country, after all!&rdquo; said I to myself, as
I entered the great gate of the <i>Hôtel des Pays-Bas</i>; &ldquo;and a
heavy, barge-built, web-footed race are its inhabitants,&rdquo; I added, as
I passed a huge amphibious wench on the stairs, who, with her
stern towards me, was sluicing the windows with water: &ldquo;however,
there is fresh air, and that, with solitude, is all I here desire!&rdquo;
This frail sentimental sentence was hardly concluded, when a
Dutch waiter (whose figure I will not misrepresent by calling him
&ldquo;garcon&rdquo;) popped a long carte, or bill of fare, into my hands,
which severely reproved me for having many other wants besides
those so simply expressed in my soliloquy.</p>

<p>As I did not feel equal to appearing in public, I had dinner apart
in my own room; and, as soon as I came to that part of the ceremony
called dessert, I gradually raised my eyes from the field of
battle, until leaning backwards in my chair to ruminate, I could
not help first admiring, for a few moments, the height and immense
size of an apartment, in which there seemed to be elbow-room for
a giant.</p>

<p>Close before the window was the great river upon whose glassy
surface I had often and often been a traveller; and, flowing beneath
me, it occurred to me, as I sipped my wine, that in its transit,
or course of existence, it had attained at Rotterdam, as nearly as
possible, the same period in its life as my own. Its birth, its froward
infancy, and its wayward youth, were remote distances to
which even fancy could now scarcely re-transport us. In its full
vigour, the Rhine had been doomed turbulently to struggle with
difficulties and obstructions which had seemed almost capable of
arresting it in its course; and if there was now nothing left in its
existence worth admiring&mdash;if its best scenery had vanished&mdash;if its
boundaries had become flat, and its banks insipid, still there was
an expansion in its broader surface, and a deep-settled stillness in
its course, which seemed to offer tranquillity instead of ecstasy, and
perfect contentment instead of imperfect joy. I felt that in the whole
course of the river there was no part of it I desired to exchange
for the water flowing slowly before me; and though it must very
shortly, I knew, be lost in the ocean, that great emblem of eternity,
yet in every yard of its existence that fate had been foretold to it.</p>

<p>Not feeling disposed again so immediately to endure the confinement
of a vessel, I walked out, and succeeded in hiring a carriage,
which, in two days, took me to Cologne, and the following morning
I accordingly embarked, <i>at six o'clock</i>, in a steam-boat, which
was to reach Coblentz in eleven hours.</p>

<p>As everybody, now-a-days, has been up the Rhine, I will only
say, that I started in a fog, and, for a couple of hours, was very
coolly enveloped in it. My <i>compagnons de voyage</i> were tricolored&mdash;Dutch,
German and French; and, excepting always myself, there
was nothing English&mdash;nothing, at least, but a board, which sufficiently
explained the hungry, insatiable inquisitiveness of our travellers.
The black thing hung near the tiller, and upon it there was
painted, in white letters, the following sentence, which I copied
literatim:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&ldquo;Enfering any conversation with the Steersner and Pilotes is desired to be forborn.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>On account of the fog, we could see nothing, yet, once or twice,
we steered towards the tinkling invitation of a bell; stopped for a
moment&mdash;took in passengers, and proceeded. The manner in
which these Rhine steam-vessels receive and deliver passengers,
carriages, and horses, is most admirable: at each little village, the
birth of a new traveller, or the death or departure of an old one,
does not detain the vessel ten seconds: but the little ceremony
being over, on it instantly proceeds, worming and winding its way
towards its destination.</p>

<p>Formerly, and until lately, a few barges, towed by horses, were
occasionally seen toiling against the torrent of the Rhine, while immense
rafts of timber, curiously connected together, floated indolently
downward to their market: in history, therefore, this uncommercial
river was known principally for its violence, its difficulties,
and its dangers. Excepting to the painter, its points most distinguished
were those where armies had succeeded in crossing, or
where soldiers had perished in vainly attempting to do so; but the
power of steam, bringing its real character into existence, has lately
developed peaceful properties which it was not known to have possessed.
The stream which once relentlessly destroyed mankind,
now gives to thousands their bread;&mdash;that which once separated
nations, now brings them together;&mdash;national prejudices, which, it
was once impiously argued, this river was wisely intended to maintain,
are, by its waters, now softened and decomposed: in short,
the Rhine affords another proof that there is nothing really barren
in creation but man&rsquo;s conceptions, nothing defective but his own
judgment, and that what he looked upon as a barrier in Europe,
was created to become one of the great pavés in the world.</p>

<p>As the vessel proceeded towards Coblentz, it continually paused
in its fairy course, apparently to barter and traffic in the prisoners
it contained&mdash;sometimes stopping off one little village, it exchanged
an infirm old man for two country girls; and then, as if laughing
at its bargain, gaily proceeding, it paused before another
picturesque hamlet, to give three Prussian soldiers of the 36th
regiment for a husband, a mother, and a child; once it delivered
an old woman, and got nothing;&mdash;then, luckily, it received two
carriages for a horse, and next it stopped a second to take up a
tall, thin, itinerant poet, who, as soon as he had collected from
every passenger a small contribution, for having recited two or
three little pieces, was dropped at the next village, ready to board
the steam-vessel coming down from Mainz.</p>

<p>In one of these cartels, or exchanges of prisoners, we received
on board Sir &mdash;&mdash; and Lady &mdash;&mdash;, a young fashionable English
couple, who having had occasion, a fortnight before, to go together
to St-George&rsquo;s Church, had (like dogs suffering from hydrophobia
or tin canisters) been running straight forwards ever since. As hard
as they could drive, they had posted to Dover&mdash;hurried across to
Calais&mdash;thence to Brussels&mdash;snapped a glance at the ripe corn
waving on the field of Waterloo,&mdash;stared at the relics of that great
<i>Saint</i>, old Charlemagne, on the high altar of Aix-la-Chapelle, and
at last sought for rest and connubial refuge at Coln; but the celebrated
water of that town, having in its manufacture evidently abstracted
all perfume from the atmosphere, they could not endure
the dirt and smell of the place, and, therefore, had proceeded by
land towards Coblentz; but, as they were changing horses at a small
village, seeing our steam-boat in view, they ordered a party of peasants
to draw their carriage to the banks of the river, and as soon
as our vessel, which came smoking alongside, began to hiss, they,
their rosy, fresh-coloured French maid, their dark, chocolate-coloured
chariot, and their brown, ill-looking Italian courier, came
on board.</p>

<p>As soon as this young London couple lightly stepped on deck, I
saw, at one glance, that without at all priding themselves on their
abilities, they fancied, and indeed justly fancied, that they belonged
to that class of society which, in England, so modestly calls itself&mdash;<i>good</i>.
That it was not healthy society&mdash;that its victims were exposed
to late hours, crowded rooms, and impure air, was evident enough
from the contrast which existed between their complexions, and
that of their healthy country attendant; however, they seemed not
only to be perfectly satisfied with themselves, and the clique which
they had left behind them, but to have a distaste for everything else
they saw. Towards some German ladies, who had slightly bowed
to them as they passed, they looked with a vacant haughty stare,
as if they conceived there must be some mistake, and as if, at all
events, it would be necessary to keep such people off. Yet, after
all, there was no great harm in these two young people: that, in
the countries which they were about to visit, they would be fitted
only for each other, was sadly evident; however, on the other hand,
it was also evidently their wish not to extend their acquaintance.
Their heads were lanthorns, illuminated with no more brains than
barely sufficient to light them on their way; and so, like the babes
in the wood, they sat together, hand-in-hand, regardless of everything
in creation but themselves.</p>

<p>For running their carriage down to the shore, the brown confidential
courier, whose maxim was, of course, to pay little and
charge much, offered the gang of peasants some kreutzers, which
amounted, in English currency, to about sixpence. This they refused,
and the captain of the party, while arguing with the flint-skinning
courier, was actually carried off by our steam-boat, which,
like time and tide, waited for no man. The poor fellow, finding
that the Italian was immoveable, came aft to the elegant English
couple, who were still leaning towards each other like the Siamese
boys. He pleaded his case, stated his services, declared his
poverty, and, in a manly voice, prayed for redress. The dandy
listened&mdash;looked at his boots, which were evidently pinching him,&mdash;listened&mdash;passed
four white fingers through the curls of his jet-black
hair&mdash;showed the point of a pink tongue gently playing with
a front tooth, and when the vulgar story was at an end, without
moving a muscle in his countenance, in a sickly tone of voice, he
pronounced his verdict as follows ........ &ldquo;<i>Alley!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The creditor tried again, but the debtor sat as silent and as inanimate
as a corpse. However, all this time the steam-boat dragging
the poor peasant out of his way, he protested in a few angry
exclamations against the injustice with which he had been treated
(a sentiment I was very sorry to hear more than once mildly whispered
by many a quiet-looking German), and descending the vessel&rsquo;s
side into a small boat, which had just brought us a new captive, he
landed at a village from which he had about eight miles to walk
to join his comrades.</p>

<p>It is with no satirical feeling that I have related this little occurrence.
To hurt the feelings of &ldquo;gay beings born to flutter but a
day&rdquo;&mdash;to break such a pair of young, flimsy butterflies upon the
wheel, affords me neither amusement nor delight; but the every-day
occurrence of English travellers committing our well-earned
national character for justice and liberality to the base, slave-driving
hand of a courier, is a practice which, as well as the bad taste
of acting the part of a London dandy on the great theatre of Europe,
ought to be checked.</p>

<p>As we proceeded up the Rhine, there issued from one of the old
romantic castles we were passing a party of young English lads,
whose appearance (as soon as they came on board) did ample
justice to their country; and, comparing them while they walked
the deck, with the rest of their fellow-prisoners, I could not help
more than once fancying that I saw a determination in their step,
a latent character in their attitudes, and a vigour in their young
frames, which being interpreted, said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;We dare do all that doth become a man,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He who dares more&mdash;is none!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Besides these young collegians, an English gentleman came on
board, who appeared quite delighted to join their party. He was
a stout man, of about fifty, tall, well-dressed, evidently wealthy,
and as ruddy as our mild wholesome air could make him. Not
only had he a high colour, but there was a network of red veins in
his cheeks, which seemed as if not even death could drive it away:
his face shone from excessive cleanliness, and though his nose certainly
was not long, there was a sort of round bull-dog honesty in
his face, which it was quite delightful to gaze upon. I overheard
this good man inform his countrymen, who had surrounded him in
a group, that he had never before been out of England&mdash;and that,
to tell the truth, he never wished to quit it again! &ldquo;It&rsquo;s surely
beautiful scenery!&rdquo; observed one of his auditors, pointing to the
outline of a ruin which, with the rock upon which it stood, seemed
flying away behind us. &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; replied the florid traveller.
&ldquo;But, sir! it&rsquo;s the dirtiness of the people I complain of. Their
cookery is dirty&mdash;they are dirty in their persons&mdash;dirty in their
habits&mdash;that shocking trick of smoking (pointing to a fat German
who was enjoying this pleasure close by his side, and who I rather
suspect perfectly understood English) is dirty&mdash;depend upon it,
they are what we should call, sir, a very dirty race!&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you
speak the language?&rdquo; said one of the young listeners with a smile
which was very awkwardly repressed. &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; replied the
well-fed gentleman, laughing good-naturedly: &ldquo;I know nothing of
their language. I pay for all I eat, and I find, by paying, I can
get anything I want. &ldquo;<i>Mangez! changez!</i>&rdquo; is quite foreign language
enough, sir, for <i>me</i>;&rdquo; and having to the first word suited his
action, by pointing with his fore-finger to his mouth, and to explain
the second, having rubbed his thumb against the self-same finger,
as if it were counting out money, he joined the roar of laughter
which his two French words had caused, and then very good-naturedly
paced the deck by himself.</p>

<p>The jagged spires of Coblentz now came in sight, and every
Englishman walked to the head of the vessel to see them, while
several of the inhabitants of the city, with less curiosity, occupied
themselves in leisurely getting together their luggage. For a moment,
as we glided by the Moselle, on our right, we looked up
the course of that lovely river, which here delivers up its waters to
the Rhine; in a few minutes the bell on board rang, and continued
to ring, until we found ourselves firmly moored to the pier of Coblentz.
Most of the passengers went into the town. I, however,
crossing the bridge of boats, took up my quarters at the Cheval
Blanc, a large hotel, standing immediately beneath that towering
rock so magnificently crowned by the celebrated fortress of Ehrenbreitstein.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_JOURNEY" id="THE_JOURNEY">THE JOURNEY.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day, starting from Coblentz while the morning air was
still pure and fresh, I bade adieu to the picturesque river behind
me, and travelling on a capital macadamized road which cuts
across the duchy of Nassau from Coblentz to Mainz, I immediately
began to ascend the mountains, which on all sides were beautifully
covered with wood. In about two hours, descending into a narrow
valley, I passed through Bad-Ems, a small village, which, composed
of hovels for its inhabitants, and, comparatively speaking,
palaces for its guests, is pleasantly enough situated on the bank of
a stream of water (the Lahn), imprisoned on every side by mountains
which I should think very few of its visiters would be disposed
to scale; and, from the little I saw of this place, I must own
I felt but little disposition to remain in it. Its outline, though much
admired, gives a cramped, contracted picture of the resources and
amusements of the place, and as I drove through it (my postilion,
with huge orange-coloured worsted tassels at his back, proudly
playing a discordant voluntary on his horn), I particularly remarked
some stiff, formal little walks, up and down which many
well-dressed strangers were slowly promenading; but the truth is,
that Ems is a regular, fashionable watering-place.</p>

<p>Many people, I fully admit, go there to drink the waters only
because they are salutary, but a very great many more visit it from
far different motives; and it is sad, as well as odd enough, that
young ladies who are in a consumption, and old ladies who have a
number of gaudy bonnets to display, find it equally desirable to
come to Bad-Ems. This mixture of sickness and finery&mdash;this confusion
between the hectic flush and red and white ribands&mdash;in
short, this dance of death, is not the particular sort of folly I am
fond of; and, though I wish to deprive no human being of his
hobby-horse, yet I must repeat I was glad enough to leave dukes
and duchesses, princes and ambassadors (whose carriages I saw
standing in one single narrow street), to be cooped up together in
the hot, expensive little valley of Ems,&mdash;an existence, to my humble
taste, not altogether unlike that which the foul witch, Sycorax,
inflicted upon Ariel, when, &ldquo;in her most unmitigable rage,&rdquo; she
left him hitched in a cloven pine.</p>

<p>On leaving Ems, the road passing through the old mouldering
town of Nassau, and under the beautiful ruins of the ducal Stamm-Schlosz
in its neighbourhood, by a very steep acclivity, continues to
ascend until it mounts at last into a sort of upper country, from
various points of which are to be seen extensive views of the exalted
duchy of Nassau, the features of which are on a very large
scale.</p>

<p>No one, I think, can breathe this dry, fresh air for a single moment,
or gaze for an instant on the peculiar colour of the sky, without
both smelling and seeing that he is in a country very considerably
above the level of the sea; yet this upper story, when it be
once attained is by no means what can be termed a mountainous
country. On the contrary, the province is composed either of flat
table-land abruptly intersected by valleys, or rather of an undulation
of hills and dales on an immense scale. In the great
tract thus displayed to view, scarcely a habitation is to be seen,
and for a considerable time I could not help wondering what had
become of the people who had sown the crops (as far I could
see they were in solitude waving around me), and who of course
were somewhere or other lurking in ambush for the harvest: however,
their humble abodes are almost all concealed in steep ravines,
or water-courses, which in every direction intersect the
whole of the region I have described. A bird&rsquo;s-eye view would
of course detect these little villages, but from any one point, as the
eye roams over the surface, they are not to be seen. The duchy,
which is completely unenclosed, for there is not even a fence to the
orchards, appears like a royal park on a gigantic scale, about one-half
being in corn-fields or uncultivated land, and the remainder
in patches of woods and forests, which in shape and position resemble
artificial plantations. The province, as far as one can see,
thus seems to declare that it has but one lord and master, and the
various views it presents are really very grand and imposing. A
considerable portion of the wood grows among crags and rocks;
and among the open land there is a great deal of what is evidently
a mining country, with much indicating the existence of both iron
and silver. The crops of wheat, oats, and barley, are rather
light, yet they are very much better than one would expect from
the ground from which they grow; but this is the effect of the extraordinary
heavy dews which, during the whole summer, may be
said, once in twenty-four hours, to irrigate the land.</p>

<p>The small steep ravines I have mentioned are the most romantic
little spots that can well be conceived. The rugged sides of the
hills which contain them are generally clothed with oak, or beech
trees, feathering to the very bottom, where a strip of green, rich,
grassy land full of springs, scarcely broader than, and very much
resembling, the moat of an old castle, is all that divides the one
wooded eminence from the other; and it is into these secluded
gardens, these smiling happy valleys, that the inhabitants of Nassau
have humbly crept for shelter. These valleys are often scarcely
broad enough to contain the single street which forms the village,
and from such little abodes, looking upwards, one would fancy
that one were living in a mountainous country; but, climb the hill&mdash;break
the little petty barrier that imprisons you, and from the
height, gently undulating before you, is the vast, magnificent
country I have described. In short, in the two prospects, one reads
the old story&mdash;one sees the common picture of human life. Beneath
lies the little contracted nook in which we were born, studded with
trifling objects, each of which we once fancied to be highly important;
every little rock has its name, and every inch of ground
belongs to one man, and therefore does not belong to another; but,
lying prostrate before us, is a great picture of the world, and until
he has seen it, no one born and bred below could fancy how vast
are its dimensions, or how truly insignificant are the billows of that
puddle in a storm from which he has somehow or other managed
to escape. But, without metaphor, nothing can be more striking
than the contrast which exists between the little valleys of this
duchy, and the great country which soars above them!</p>

<p>With respect to the climate of Nassau, without presuming to
dictate upon that subject, I will, while my postilion is jolting me
along, request the reader to decipher for himself hieroglyphics
which I think sufficiently explain it. In short, I beg leave to offer
him the milk of information&mdash;warm as I suck it from the cow.</p>

<p>At this moment, everything, see! is smiling; the trees are in
full leaf; the crops in full bearing. In no part of Devonshire or
Herefordshire have I ever seen such rich crops of apples, the trees
being here surrounded with a scaffolding of poles, which after all
seem scarcely sufficient to save the boughs from breaking under
their load; but I ask&mdash;How comes the vine to be absent from this
gay scene? the low country and even the lower part of Nassau, we
all know, teems with vineyards, and for some way have they
crawled up the sides of the mountain; the reason, therefore, for
their not appearing in the high ground is surely one very legible
character of the climate.</p>

<p>Again, at all the bendings of the valleys, why do the trees appear
so stunted in their growth, and why are so many of them stag-headed?
They must surely have some sad reason for wearing
this appearance, and any one may guess what it is that in the winter
rushes by them with such violence, that, instinctively, they seem
more anxious to grow beneath the soil than above it. Again, under
that hot, oppressive sun which is now hurrying every crop to maturity,
why do not the inhabitants look like Neapolitans and other
indolent Lazzaroni-living people?&mdash;how comes it that their features
are so hard?&mdash;Can the <i>sun</i> have beaten them into that shape?</p>

<p>Why are the houses they live in huddled together in the valleys,
instead of enjoying the magnificent prospect before me? Why do
the wealthiest habitations look to the south, and why are the roofs
of the houses built or pitched so perpendicularly that it seems as if
nothing could rest upon their surface? Why are the windows so
small and the walls so thick? I might torment my reader with
many other questions, such as why, in this large country, is there
scarcely a bird to be seen? but I dare say he has already determined
for himself, whether the lofty province of Nassau, during the
winter, be hot or cold; in short, what must be its climate at the
moment when the Rhine and the expanse of low country, lying
about 1200 feet beneath it, is frozen and covered with snow?</p>

<p>Yet whatever may be the climate of the upper country of Nassau,
the duchy, taken altogether, may fairly be said to contribute more
than an average share towards the luxuries and comforts of mankind.
Besides fine timber-trees of oak, beech, birch, and fir, there
are crops of corn of every sort, as well as potatoes which would
not be despised in England; several of the wines (for instance,
those on the estates of Hochheim, Eberbach, Rudesheim, and Johannisburg)
are the finest on the Rhine, while there are fruits, such
as apples, pears, cherries, apricots, strawberries, raspberries (the
two latter growing wild), &amp;c., &amp;c. in the greatest abundance.</p>

<p>Not only are there mines of the precious metals and of iron, but
there is also coal, which we all know will, when the gigantic
powers of steam are developed, become the nucleus of every nation&rsquo;s
wealth. In addition to all this, the duchy is celebrated over
the whole of Germany for its mineral waters; and certainly if they
be at all equal to the reputation they have acquired, Nassau may
be said to contribute to mankind what is infinitely better than all
wealth, namely&mdash;health.</p>

<p>From its hills burst mineral streams of various descriptions, and
besides the Selters or Seltzer water, which is drunk as a luxury in
every quarter of the globe, there are bright, sparkling remedies
prescribed for almost every disorder under the sun;&mdash;for instance,
should the reader be consumptive, or, what is much more probable,
be dyspeptic, let him hurry to Ems; if he wishes to instil
iron into his jaded system, and brace up his muscles, let him go to
Langen-Schwalbach; if his brain should require calming, his nerves
soothing, and his skin softening, let him glide onwards to Schlangenbad&mdash;the
serpent&rsquo;s bath; but if he should be rheumatic in his
limbs, or if mercury should be running riot in his system, let him
hasten, &ldquo;body and bones,&rdquo; to Wiesbaden, where, they say, by
being parboiled in the Kochbrunnen (boiling spring), all his troubles
will evaporate.</p>

<p>To these different waters of Nassau flock annually thousands and
thousands of people from all parts of Germany; and so celebrated
are they for the cures which they have effected, that not only do
people also come from Russia, Poland, Denmark, &amp;c., but a vast
quantity of the waters, in stone bottles, is annually sent to these remote
countries. Yet it is odd enough, that the number of English,
who have visited the mineral springs of Nassau, bears no proportion
to that of any other nation of Europe, although Spa, and some
other continental watering-places, have been much deserted by
foreigners, on account of the quantity of the British who have
thronged there; but, somehow or other, our country people are
like locusts, for they not only fly in myriads to distant countries,
but, as they travel, they congregate in clouds, and, therefore,
either are they found absolutely eating up a foreign country, or not
one of them is to be seen there. How many thousands and hundreds
of thousands of English, with their mouths, eyes, and purses wide
open, have followed each other, in mournful succession, up and
down the Rhine; and yet, though Nassau has stood absolutely in
their path, I believe I may assert that not twenty families have taken
up their abode at Langen-Schwalbach or Schlangenbad in the
course of the last twenty years; and yet there is no country on
earth that could turn out annually more consumptive, rheumatic,
and dyspeptic patients than old England! In process of time, the
little duchy will, no doubt, be as well known as Cheltenham, Malvern,
&amp;c.; however, until fashion, that painted direction-post,
points her finger towards it, it will continue (so far as we are concerned)
to exist, as it really does, <i>in nubibus</i>.</p>

<p>There are 56,712 human habitations in the duchy of Nassau,
and 355,815 human beings to live in them. Of these, 188,244
are Protestants, 161,535 are Catholics; there are 191 Mennonitens
or dissenters; and scattered among these bleak hills, just as their
race is mysteriously scattered over the face of the globe, there are
5845 Jews. The Duke of Nassau is the cacique, king, emperor, or
commander-in-chief of the province; and people here are everlastingly
talking of <em class="smcap">the</em> Duke, as in England they talk of <i>the</i> sun, <i>the</i>
moon, or any other luminary of which there exists only one in our
system. He is certainly the sovereign lord of this lofty country;
and travelling along, I have just observed a certain little bough
sticking out of every tenth sheaf of corn, the meaning of which is,
no doubt, perfectly well understood both by him and the peasant:
in short, in all the principal villages, there are barns built on purpose
for receiving this tribute, with a man, paid by the Duke, for
collecting it.</p>

<p>In approaching Langen-Schwalbach, being of course anxious,
as early as possible, to get a glimpse of a town which I had already
determined to inhabit for a few days, I did all in my power to explain
this feeling to the dull, gaudy fellow who drove me; but
whenever I inquired for Langen-Schwalbach, so often did the
mute creature point with a long German whip to the open country,
as if it existed directly before him; but, no, not a human habitation
could I discover! However, as I proceeded onwards, the whip,
in reply to my repeated interrogatories to its dumb owner, began to
show a short of magnetical dip, until, at last, it pointed almost perpendicularly
downwards into a ravine, which was now immediately
beneath me; yet though I could see, as I thought, almost to
the bottom of it, still not a vestige of a town was to be seen. However,
the whip was quite right, for, in a very few seconds, peeping
up from the very bottom of the valley, I perceived, like poplar trees,
a couple of church steeples; then suddenly came in sight a long
narrow village of slated roofs, and, in a very few seconds more, I
found my carriage rattling and trumpetting along a street, until it
stopped at the Goldene Kette, or, as we should call it, the Golden
Chain. The master of this hotel appeared to be a most civil,
obliging person; and though his house was nearly full, yet he
suddenly felt so much respect either for me or for the contents of
my wallet, which, in descending from the carriage, I had placed, for
a moment, in his hands, that he used many arguments to persuade
us both to become noble appendages to his fine Golden Chain: yet
there were certain noises, uncertain smells, and a degree of bustle
in his house which did not at all suit me; and, therefore, at once
mercifully annihilating his hopes by a grave bow which could not
be misinterpreted, I slowly walked into the street to select for myself
a private lodging, and, for a considerable time, experienced
very great difficulty. With hands clasped behind me, in vain did I
slowly stroll about, looking out for any thing at all like a paper or a
board in a window; and I was beginning to fear that there were no
lodging-houses in the town, when I at last found out that there
were very few which were not. I therefore selected a clean, quiet-looking
dwelling; and, finding the inside equal to the out, I at once
engaged apartments.</p>

<p>The next morning (having been refreshed by a good night&rsquo;s rest)
I put a small note-book into my pocket, and having learnt that in
the whole valley there was no English blood, except the little that
was within my own black silk waistcoat, I felt that I might go where
I liked, do what I liked, and sketch the outline of whatever either
pleased my eye, or amused my fancy. My first duty, however,
evidently was to understand the geography of the town, or rather
village, of Langen-Schwalbach, which I found to be in the shape
of the letter Y, or (throwing, as I wish to do, literature aside) of a
long-handled two-pronged fork. The village is 1500 paces in
length, that is to say, the prongs are each about 500 yards, and the
lower street, or handle of the fork, is about 1000 yards.</p>

<p>On the first glimpse of the buildings from the heights, my eyes
had been particularly attracted by high, irregular, slated roofs,
many of which were fantastically ornamented with little spires,
about two feet high, but it now appeared that the buildings themselves
were constructed even more irregularly than their roofs.
The village is composed of houses of all sizes, shapes, and colours:
some, having been lately plastered, and painted yellow, white, or
pale green, have a modern appearance, while others wear a dress
about as old as the hills which surround them. Of these latter,
some are standing with their sides towards the streets, others look
at you with their gables; some overhang the passenger as if they
intended to crush him; some shrink backwards, as if, like misanthropes,
they loathed him, or like maidens, they feared him; some
lean sideways, as if they were suffering from a painful disorder in
their hips; many, apparently from curiosity, have advanced, while
a few, in disgust, have retired a step or two.</p>

<p>All the best dwellings in the towns are &ldquo;hofs,&rdquo; or lodging-houses,
having jalousies, or Venetian blinds, to the windows; and
I must own I did not expect to find in so remote a situation houses
of such large dimensions. For instance, the Allee Saal has nineteen
windows in front; the great &ldquo;Indien Hof&rdquo; is three stories high,
with sixteen windows in each; the Pariser Hof has twelve, and several
others have eight and ten.</p>

<p>Of late years a number of the largest houses have been plastered
on the outside, but the appearance of the rest is highly picturesque.
They are built of wood and unburnt bricks, but the
immense quantity of timber which has been consumed would clearly
indicate the vicinity of a large forest, even if one could not see its
dark foliage towering on every side above the town. Wood having
been of so little value, it has been crammed into the houses, as if
the builder&rsquo;s object had been to hide away as much of it as possible.
The whole fabric is a network of timber of all lengths, shapes,
and sizes; and these limbs, sometimes rudely sculptured, often bent
into every possible contortion, form a confused picture of rustic architecture,
which amid such wild mountain scenery one cannot
refuse to admire. The interstices between all this woodwork are
filled up with brown, unburnt bricks, so soft and porous, that in our
moist climate they would in one winter be decomposed, while a
very few seasons would also rot the timbers which they connect:
however, such is evidently the dryness of mountain air, that buildings
can exist here in this rude state, and, indeed, have existed, for
several hundred years, with the woodwork unpainted.</p>

<p>In rambling about the three streets, one is surprised, at first, at
observing that apparently there is scarcely a shop in the town!
Before three or four windows carcasses of sheep, or of young calves
but a few days old, are seen hanging by their heels; and loaves of
bread are placed for sale before a very few doors: but, generally
speaking, the dwellings are either &ldquo;hofs&rdquo; for lodgers, or they appear
to be a set of nondescript private-houses; nevertheless, by
patiently probing, the little shop is at last discovered. In one of
these secluded dens one can buy coffee, sugar, butter, nails, cottons,
chocolate, ribands, brandy, &amp;c. Still, however, there is no external
display of any such articles, for the crowd of rich people
who, like the swallows, visit during the summer weeks the sparkling
water of Langen-Schwalbach, live at &ldquo;hofs,&rdquo; whose proprietors
well enough know where to search for what they want. During
so short a residence there, fashionable visiters require no new
clothes, nails, brimstone, or coarse linen. It is, therefore, useless
for the little shopkeeper to attempt to gain their custom; and as,
during the rest of the year, the village exists in simplicity, quietness,
and obscurity, the inhabitants, knowing each other, require neither
signs nor inscriptions. Peasants come to Langen-Schwalbach
from other villages, inquire for the sort of shop which will suit
them; or if they want (as they generally do) tobacco, oil, or some
rancid commodity, their noses are quite intelligent enough to lead
them to the doors they ought to enter; indeed, I myself very soon
found that it was quite possible thus to hunt for my own game.</p>

<p>I have already stated that Langen-Schwalbach is like a kitchen
fork, the handle of which is the lower or old part of the town: the
prongs representing two streets built in ravines, down each of which
a small stream of water descends. The Stahl brunnen (steel spring)
is at the head of the town, at the upper extremity of the right prong.
Close to the point of the other prong is the Wein brunnen (wine
spring), and about 600 yards up the same valley is situated the
fashionable brunnen of Pauline. Between these three points, brunnens,
or wells, the visiters at Langen-Schwalbach, with proper intervals
for rest and food, are everlastingly vibrating. Backwards
and forwards, &ldquo;down the middle and up again,&rdquo; the strangers are
seen walking, or rather crawling, with a constancy that is really
quite astonishing. Among the number there may be here and there
a C&oelig;lebs in search of a wife, and a very few <i>sets</i> of much smaller
feet may, <i>impari passu</i>, be occasionally seen pursuing nothing
but their mammas; however, generally speaking, the whole troop
is chasing one and the same game; they are all searching for the
same treasure&mdash;in short, they are seeking for health: but it is now
necessary that the reader should be informed by what means they
hope to attain it.</p>

<p>In the time of the Romans, Schwalbach, which means literally the
swallow&rsquo;s stream, was a forest containing an immense sulphureous
fountain famed for its medicinal effects. In proportion as it rose
into notice, hovels, huts, and houses were erected; until a small
street or village was thus gradually established on the north and south
of the well. There was little to offer to the stranger but its waters;
yet, health being a commodity which people have always been willing
enough to purchase, the medicine was abundantly drunk, and
in the same proportion the little hamlet continued to grow, until it
justly attained and claimed for itself the appellation of Langen (long)
Schwalbach.</p>

<p>About sixty years ago the Stahl and Wein brunnens were discovered.
These springs were found to be quite different from the
old one, inasmuch as, instead of being only sulphureous, they were
but strongly impregnated with iron and carbonic acid gas. Instead,
therefore, of merely purifying the blood, they boldly undertook to
strengthen the human frame; and, in proportion as they attracted
notice, so the old original brunnen became neglected. About three
years ago a new spring was discovered in the valley above the Wein
brunnen; this did not contain quite so much iron as the Stahl or
Wein brunnen; but possessing other ingredients (among them that
of novelty) which were declared to be more salutary, it was patronised
by Dr. Fenner, as being preferable to the brimstone as well as
other brunnens in the country. It was accordingly called Pauline,
after the present Duchess of Nassau, and is now the fashionable
brunnen or well of Langen-Schwalbach.</p>

<p>The village doctors, however, disagree on the subject; and Dr.
Stritter, a very mild, sensible man, recommends his patients to the
strong Stahl brunnen, almost as positively as Dr. Fenner sentences
his victims to the Pauline. Which is right, and which is wrong, is one
of the mysteries of this world; but as the cunning Jews all go to the
Stahl brunnen, I strongly suspect that they have some good reason
for this departure from the fashion.</p>

<p>As I observed people of all shapes, ages, and constitutions,
swallowing the waters of Langen-Schwalbach, I felt that, being
absolutely on the brink of the brunnen, I might, at least as an experiment,
join this awkward squad&mdash;that it would be quite time enough
to desert if I should find reason to do so&mdash;in short, that by trying the
waters I should have a surer proof whether they agreed with me or
not, than by listening to the conflicting opinions of all the doctors in the
universe. However, not knowing exactly in what quantities to take
them,&mdash;having learnt that Dr. Fenner himself had the greatest
number of patients, and that moreover being a one-eyed man he
was much the easiest to be found, I walked towards the shady walk
near the Allee Saal, resolving eventually to consult him; however,
in turning a sharp corner, happening almost to run against a gentleman
in black, &ldquo;cui lumen ademptum,&rdquo; I gravely accosted him, and
finding, as I did in one moment, that I was right, in the middle of
the street I began to explain that he saw before him a wheel which
wanted a new tire&mdash;a shoe which required a new sole&mdash;a worn-out
vessel seeking the hand of the tinker; in short, that feeling very old,
I merely wanted to become young again.</p>

<p>Dr. Fenner is what would be called in England &ldquo;a regular
character,&rdquo; and being a shrewd, clever fellow, he evidently finds
it answer, and endeavours to maintain a singularity of manner,
which with his one eye (the other being extinguished in a college
duel) serves to bring him into general notice. As soon as my
gloomy tale was concluded, the Doctor, who had been walking at
my side, stopped dead short, and when I turned round to look for
him, there I saw him, with his right arm extended, its fore-finger
and thumb clenched, as if holding snuff, and its other three digits
horizontally extended like the hand of a direction-post. With his
heels close together, he stood as lean and as erect as a ramrod, the
black patch which like a hatchment hung over the window of
his departed eye being supported by a riband wound diagonally
round his head. &ldquo;Monsieur!&rdquo; said he (for he speaks a little
French), &ldquo;Monsieur!&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;à six heures du matin vous
prendrez à la Pauline trois verres! trois verres à la Pauline!&rdquo; he
repeated. &ldquo;A dix heures vous prendrez un bain&mdash;en sortant du
bain vous prendrez .. (he paused, and after several seconds of deep
thought, he added) .. encore deux verres, et à cinq heures du
soir, Monsieur, vous prendrez .. (another long pause) .. encore
trois verres! Monsieur! ces eaux vous feront beaucoup de bien!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The arm of this sybil now fell to his side, like the limb of a
telegraph which had just concluded its intelligence. The Doctor
made me a low bow, spun round upon his heel, &ldquo;and so he
vanished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had not exactly bargained for bathing in, as well as drinking,
the waters; however, feeling in great good-humour with the little
world I was inhabiting, I was willing to go with (i. e. <i>into</i>) its
stream; and as I found that almost every visiter was daily soaked
for an hour or two, I could not but admit that what was prescribed
for such geese, might also be good sauce for the gander; and that
at all events a bath would at least have the advantage of drowning
for me one hour per day, in case I should find four-and-twenty of
such visiters more than I wanted.</p>

<p>In a very few days I got quite accustomed to what a sailor would
call the &ldquo;fresh-water life&rdquo; which had been prescribed for me; and
as no clock in the universe could be more regular than my behaviour,
an account of one day&rsquo;s performances, multiplied by the
number I remained, will give the reader, very nearly, the history
or picture of an existence at Langen-Schwalbach.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_REVEILLE" id="THE_REVEILLE">THE REVEILLE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> a quarter past five I arose, and as soon after as possible left
the &ldquo;hof.&rdquo; Every house was open, the streets already swept, the
inhabitants all up, the living world appeared broad awake, and
there was nothing to denote the earliness of the hour, but the
delicious freshness of the cool mountain air; which as yet, unenfeebled
by the sun, just beaming above the hill, was in that pure
state, in which it had all night long been slumbering in the valley.
The face of nature seemed beaming with health, and though there
were no larks at Schwalbach gently &ldquo;to carol at the morn,&rdquo; yet
immense red German slugs were everywhere in my path, looking
wetter, colder, fatter, and happier than they or I have words to
express. They had evidently been gorging themselves during the
night, and were now crawling into shelter to sleep away the
day.</p>

<p>As soon as, getting from beneath the shaded walk of the Allee
Saal, I reached the green valley leading to the Pauline brunnen, it
was quite delightful to look at the grass, as it sparkled in the sun,
every green blade being laden with dew in such heavy particles,
that there seemed to be quite as much water as grass; indeed the
crop was actually bending under the weight of nourishment which,
during the deep silence of night, Nature had liberally imparted to
it; and it was evident that the sun would have to rise high in the
heavens before it could attain strength enough to rob the turf of
this fertilizing and delicious treasure.</p>

<p>At this early hour, I found but few people on the walks, and on
reaching the brunnen, the first agreeable thing I received there was
a smile from a very honest, homely, healthy old woman, who
having seen me approaching, had selected from her table my glass,
the handle of which she had marked by a piece of tape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guten morgen!&rdquo; she muttered; and then, without at all deranging
the hospitality of her smile, stooping down, she dashed the
vessel into the brunnen beneath her feet, and in a sort of civil
hurry (lest any of its spirit should escape), she presented me with
a glass of her <i>eau médicinale</i>. Clear as crystal, sparkling with carbonic
acid gas, and effervescing quite as much as champagne, it
was nevertheless miserably cold; and the first morning, what with
the gas, and what with the low temperature of this cold iron water,
it was about as much as I could do to swallow it; and, for a few
seconds, feeling as if it had sluiced my stomach completely by surprise,
I stood hardly knowing what was about to happen, when,
instead of my teeth chattering, as I expected, I felt the water suddenly
grow warm within my waistcoat, and a slight intoxication,
or rather exhilaration, succeeded.</p>

<p>As I have always had an unconquerable aversion to walking backwards
and forwards on a formal parade, as soon as I had drank
my first glass I at once commenced ascending the hill which rises
immediately from the brunnen. Paths in zigzags are cut in various
directions in the wood, but so steep, that very few of the water-drinkers
like to encounter them. I found the trees to be oak and
beech, the ground beneath being covered with grass and heather,
among which were, growing wild, quantities of ripe strawberries
and raspberries. The large red snails were in great abundance,
and immense black-beetles were also in the paths, heaving at, and
pushing upwards, loads of dung, &amp;c., very much bigger than
themselves; the grass and heather were soaked with dew, and
even the strawberries looked much too wet to be eaten. However,
I may observe, that while drinking mineral waters, all fruit, wet
or dry, is forbidden. Smothered up in the wood, there was, of
course, nothing to be seen; but as soon as I gained the summit of
the hill, a very pretty hexagonal rustic hut, built of trees with the
bark on, and thatched with heather, presented itself. The sides
were open, excepting two, which were built up with sticks and
moss. A rough circular table was in the middle, upon which
two or three young people had cut their names; and round the
inner circumference of the hut there was a bench, on which I was
glad enough to rest, while I enjoyed the extensive prospect.</p>

<p>The features of this picture, so different from any thing to be seen
in England, were exceedingly large, and the round rolling clouds
seemed bigger even than the distant mountains upon which they
rested. Not a fence was to be seen, but dark patches of wood, of
various shapes and sizes, were apparently dropped down upon the
cultivated surface of the country, which, as far as the eye could
reach, looked like the fairy park of some huge giant. In the
foreground, however, small fields, and little narrow strips of land,
denoted the existence of a great number of poor proprietors; and
even if Langen-Schwalbach had not been seen crouching at the
bottom of its deep valley, it would have been quite evident that,
in the immediate neighbourhood, there must be, somewhere or
other, a town; for, in many places, the divisions of land were so
small, that one could plainly distinguish provender growing for the
poor man&rsquo;s cow,&mdash;the little patch of rye which was to become
bread for his children&mdash;and the half-acre of potatoes which was
to help them through the winter. Close to the town, these divisions
and subdivisions were exceedingly small; but when every
little family had been provided for, the fields grew larger; and at a
short distance from where I sat, there were crops, ripe and waving,
which were evidently intended for a larger and more distant
market.</p>

<p>As soon as I had sufficiently enjoyed the freshness and the
freedom of this interesting landscape, it was curious to look down
from the hut upon the walk which leads from the Allee Saal to the
brunnen or well of Pauline; for, by this time, all ranks of people
had arisen from their beds, and the sun being now warm, the <i>beau
monde</i> of Langen-Schwalbach was seen slowly loitering up and
down the promenade.</p>

<p>At the rate of about a mile and a half an hour, I observed several
hundred quiet people crawling through and fretting away
that portion of their existence which lay between one glass of cold
iron water and another. If an individual were to be sentenced to
such a life, which, in fact, has all the fatigue without the pleasing
sociability of the treadmill, he would call it melancholy beyond
endurance; yet there is no pill which fashion cannot gild, or which
habit cannot sweeten. I remarked that the men were dressed,
generally, in loose, ill-made, snuff-coloured great coats, with
awkward travelling caps, of various shapes, instead of hats. The
picture, therefore, taking it altogether, was a homely one; but,
although there were no particularly elegant or fashionable-looking
people, although their gait was by no means attractive, yet even,
from the lofty distant hut, I felt it was impossible to help admiring
the good sense and good feeling with which all the elements of this
German community appeared to be harmonizing one with the
other. There was no jostling, or crowding; no apparent competition;
no turning round to stare at strangers. There was no
&ldquo;martial look nor lordly stride,&rdquo; but real genuine good breeding
seemed natural to all: it is true there was nothing which bore a
very high aristocratic polish; yet it was equally evident that the
substance of their society was intrinsically good enough not to
require it.</p>

<p>The behaviour of such a motley assemblage of people, who
belonged, of course, to all ranks and conditions of life, in my
humble opinion, did them and their country very great credit. It
was quite evident that every man on the promenade, whatever
might have been his birth, was desirous to behave like a gentleman;
and that there was no one, however exalted was his station,
who wished to do any more.</p>

<p>That young lady, rather more quietly dressed than the rest of
her sex, is the Princess Leuenstein; her countenance (could it but
be seen from the hut) is as unassuming as her dress, and her manner
as quiet as her bonnet. Her husband, who is one of the group
of gentlemen behind her, is mild, gentlemanlike, and (if in these
days such a title may, without offence, be given to a young man),
I would add&mdash;he is modest.</p>

<p>There are one or two other princes on the promenade, with a
very fair sprinkling of dukes, counts, barons, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="center blockquot">
&ldquo;There they go, altogether in a row!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>but though they congregate,&mdash;though like birds of a feather they
flock together, is there, I ask, anything arrogant in their behaviour?
and that respect which they meet with from every one, does
it not seem to be honestly their due? That uncommonly awkward,
short, little couple, who walk holding each other by the hand, and
who, apropos to nothing, occasionally break playfully into a
trot, are a Jew and Jewess lately married; and, as it is whispered
that they have some mysterious reason for drinking the waters,
the uxorious anxiety with which the little man presents the glass of
cold comfort to his herring-made partner, does not pass completely
unobserved. That slow gentleman, with such an immense body,
who seems to be acquainted with the most select people on the
walk, is an ambassador, who goes nowhere&mdash;no, not even to mineral
waters, without his French cook, a circumstance quite enough
to make everybody speak well of him&mdash;a very honest, good-natured
man he seems to be; but as he walks, can anything be more
evident than that his own cook is killing him, and what possible
benefit can a few glasses of cold water do to a corporation which
Falstaff&rsquo;s belt would be too short to encircle?</p>

<p>Often and often have I pitied Diogenes for having lived in a tub;
but this poor ambassador is infinitely worse off, for the tub, it is too
evident, lives in <i>him</i>, and carry it about with him he must wherever
he goes; but, without smiling at any more of my water companions,
it is time I should descend to drink my second and third glass.
One would think that this deluge of cold water would leave little
room for tea and sugar; but miraculous as it may sound, by the
time I got to my &ldquo;hof,&rdquo; there was as much stowage in the vessel
as when she sailed; besides this, the steel created an appetite which
it was very difficult to govern.</p>

<p>As soon as breakfast was over, I generally enjoyed the luxury of
idling about the town; and, in passing the shop of a blacksmith, who
lived opposite to the Goldene Kette, the manner in which he tackled
and shod a vicious horse always amused me. On the outside wall
of the house, two rings were firmly fixed; to one of which the
head of the patient was lashed close to the ground; the hind foot,
to be shod, stretched out to the utmost extent of the leg, was then
secured to the other ring about five feet high, by a cord which
passed through a cloven hitch, fixed to the root of the poor creature&rsquo;s
tail.</p>

<p>The hind foot was consequently very much higher than the head;
indeed, it was so exalted, and pulled so heavily at the tail, that the
animal seemed to be quite anxious to keep his other feet on <i>terra
firma</i>. With one hoof in the heavens, it did not suit him to kick;
with his nose pointing to the infernal regions, he could not conveniently
rear; and as the devil himself was apparently pulling at his
tail, the horse at last gave up the point, and quietly submitted to
be shod.</p>

<p>Nearly opposite to this blacksmith, sitting under the projecting
eaves of the Goldene Kette, there were to be seen, every day, a row
of women with immense baskets of fruit, which they had brought
over the hills, on their heads. The cherries were of the largest and
finest description, while the quantity of their stones lying on the
paved street, was quite sufficient to show at what a cheap rate they
were sold. Plums, apricots, greengages, apples, and pears, were
also in the greatest profusion; however, in passing these baskets,
strangers were strictly ordered to avert their eyes. In short,
whenever raw fruit and mineral water unexpectedly meet each
other in the human stomach, a sort of bubble-and-squeak contest
invariably takes place&mdash;the one always endeavouring to turn the
other out of the house.</p>

<p>The crowd of idle boys, who like wasps were always hovering
round these fruit-selling women, I often observed very amusingly
dispersed by the arrival of some German grandee in his huge travelling
carriage. For at least a couple of minutes before the thing
appeared, the postilion, as he descended the mountain, was heard,
attempting to notify to the town the vast importance of his cargo,
by playing on his trumpet a tune which, in tone and flourish,
exactly resembled that which, in London, announces the approach
of Punch. There is something always particularly harsh and discordant
in the notes of a trumpet badly blown; but when placed
to the lips of a great lumbering German postilion, who, half smothered
in his big boots and tawdry finery, has, besides this crooked
instrument, to hold the reins of two wheel horses, as well as of two
leaders, his attempt, in such deep affliction, to be musical, is comic
in the extreme; and, when the fellow at last arrived at the Goldene
Kette, playing a tune which I expected every moment would make
the head of Judy pop out of the carriage, one could not help feeling
that, if the money which that trumpet cost had been spent in
a pair of better spurs, it would have been of much more advantage
and comfort to the traveller; but German posting always reminds
me of the remark which the Black Prince was one day heard to
utter, as he was struggling with all his might to shave a pig.</p>

<p>However, though I most willingly join my fellow-countrymen in
ridiculing the tawdry heavy equipment of the German postilion,
one&rsquo;s nose always feeling disposed to turn itself upwards at the sight
of a horseman awkwardly encumbered with great, unmeaning,
yellow worsted tassels, and other broad ornaments, which seem
better adapted to our fourpost bedsteads than to a rider, yet I reluctantly
acknowledge that I do verily believe their horses are much
more scientifically harnessed, for slow heavy draught, than ours
are in England.</p>

<p>Many years have now elapsed since I first observed that, somehow
or other, the horses on the Continent manage to pull a heavy
carriage up a steep hill, or along a dead level, with greater ease to
themselves than our English horses. Let any unprejudiced person
attentively observe with what little apparent fatigue three small ill-conditioned
animals will draw not only his own carriage, but very
often that huge overgrown vehicle, the French diligence, or the
German eil-wagen, and I think he must admit that, somewhere or
other, there exists a mystery.</p>

<p>But the whole equipment is so unsightly&mdash;the rope harness is so
rude&mdash;the horses without blinkers look so wild&mdash;there is so much
bluster and noise in the postilion, that, far from paying any compliment
to the turn-out, one is very much disposed at once to condemn
the whole thing, and not caring a straw whether such horses
be fatigued or not, to make no other remark than that, in England,
they would have travelled at nearly twice the rate, with one-tenth
of the noise.</p>

<p>But neither the rate nor the noise is the question which I wish to
consider; for our superiority in the former, and our inferiority in
the latter, cannot be doubted. The thing I want, if possible, to
account for, is, how such small weak horses <i>do</i> manage to draw
one&rsquo;s carriage up hill, with so much unaccountable ease to themselves.</p>

<p>Now, in English, French, and German harness, there exist, as
it were, three degrees of comparison in the manner in which the
head of the horse is treated; for, in England, it is elevated, or borne
up, by what we call the bearing-rein; in France, it is left as nature
placed it (there being to common French harness no bearing-rein);
while, in Germany, the head is tied down to the lower extremity
of the collar, or else the collar is so made that the animal is by it
deprived of the power of raising his head.</p>

<p>Now, it is undeniable that the English extreme and the German
extreme cannot both be right; and passing over for a moment the
French method, which is, in fact, the state of nature, let us for a
moment consider which is best, to bear a horse&rsquo;s head <i>up</i>, as in
England, or to pull it <i>downwards</i>, as in Germany. In my humble
opinion, both are wrong: still there is some science in the German
error; whereas in our treatment of the poor animal, we go directly
against all mechanical calculation.</p>

<p>In a state of nature, the wild horse (as every-body knows) has
two distinct gaits or attitudes. If man, or any still wilder beast,
come suddenly upon him, up goes his head; and as he first stalks
and then trots gently away, with ears erect, snorting with his nose
and proudly snuffing up the air, as if exulting in his freedom; as
one fore-leg darts before the other, one sees before one a picture
of doubt, astonishment, and hesitation,&mdash;all of which feelings seem
to rein him, like a troop-horse, on his haunches; but attempt to
pursue him, and the moment he defies you&mdash;the moment, determining
to escape, he shakes his head, and lays himself to his work,
how completely does he alter his attitude!&mdash;for then down goes his
head, and from his ears to the tip of his tail, there is in his vertebræ
an undulating action which seems to propel him, which works
him along, and which, it is evident, you could not deprive him of,
without materially diminishing his speed.</p>

<p>Now, in harness, the horse has naturally the same two gaits or
attitudes; and it is quite true that he can start away with a carriage,
either in the one or the other; but the means by which he succeeds
in this effort, the physical powers which, in each case, he calls into
action, are essentially different; for in the one attitude he works by
his muscles, and in the other by his own dead, or rather living,
weight. In order to grind corn, if any man were to erect a steam-engine
over a fine, strong, running stream, we should all say to
him, &ldquo;Why do you not allow your wheel to be turned by cold water
instead of by hot? Why do you not avail yourself of the <i>weight</i> of
the water, instead of expending your capital in converting it into
the power of steam? In short, why do you not use the simple resource
which nature has presented ready made to your hand?&rdquo; In
the same way, the Germans might say to us, &ldquo;We acknowledge a
horse <i>can</i> drag a carriage by the power of his muscles, but why do
you not allow him to drag it by his <i>weight</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In France, and particularly in Germany, horses do draw by the
weight; and it is to encourage them to raise up their backs, and
lean downwards with their heads, that the German collars are
made in the way I have described; that with a certain degree of
rude science, the horse&rsquo;s nose is tied to the bottom of his collar, and
that the postilion at starting, speaking gently to him, allows him to
get himself into a proper attitude for his draught.</p>

<p>The horse, thus treated, leans against the resistance which he
meets with, and his weight being infinitely greater than his draught
(I mean the balance being in his favour), the carriage follows him
without much more strain or effort on his part, than if he were idly
leaning his chest against his manger. It is true the flesh of his
shoulder may become sore from severe pressure, but his sinews
and muscles are comparatively at rest.</p>

<p>Now, as a contrast to this picture of the German horse, let any
one observe a pair of English post-horses dragging a heavy weight
up a hill, and he will at once see that the poor creatures are working
by their muscles, and that it is by sinews and main strength
the resistance is overcome; but how can it be otherwise? for their
heads are considerably higher than nature intended them to be even
in <i>walking</i>, in a state of liberty, carrying nothing but themselves.
The balance of their bodies is, therefore, absolutely turned <i>against</i>,
instead of leaning in favour of, their draught, and thus cruelly deprived
of the mechanical advantage of weight which everywhere
else in the universe is duly appreciated, the noble spirit of our high-fed
horses induces them to strain and drag the carriage forwards
by their muscles; and, if the reader will but pass his hands down
the back sinews of any of our stage-coach or post-chaise horses, he
will soon feel (though not so keenly as they do) what is the fatal
consequence. It is true that, in ascending a very steep hill, an
English postilion will occasionally unhook the bearing-reins of his
horses; but the poor jaded creatures, trained for years to work in
a false attitude, cannot, in one moment, get themselves into the scientific
position which the German horses are habitually encouraged
to adopt; besides this, we are so sharp with our horses&mdash;we keep
them so constantly on the <i>qui vive</i>, or, as we term it, in hand&mdash;that
we are always driving them from the use of their weight to the application
of their sinews.</p>

<p>That the figure and attitude of a horse, working by his sinews,
are infinitely prouder than when he is working by his weight (there
may exist, however, false pride among horses as well as among
men), I most readily admit, and, therefore, for carriages of luxury,
where the weight bears little proportion to the powers of the two
noble animals, I acknowledge that the sinews are more than sufficient
for the slight labour required; but to bear up the head of a
poor horse at plough, or at any slow, heavy work, is, I humbly conceive,
a barbarous error, which ought not to be persisted in.</p>

<p>I may be quite wrong in the way in which I have just endeavoured
to account for the fact that horses on the Continent draw
heavy weights with apparently greater ease to themselves than our
horses, and I almost hope that I am wrong; for laughing, as we all
do, at the German and French harness, sneering, as we do, at their
ropes, and wondering out loud, as we always do, why they do not
copy us, it would not be a little provoking were we, in spite of our
fine harness, to find out, that for slow, heavy draught, it is better
to tie a horse&rsquo;s nose <i>downwards</i>, like the German, than <i>upwards</i>,
like the English, and that the French way of leaving them at liberty
is better than both.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BATH" id="THE_BATH">THE BATH.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> eager step with which I always walked towards the strong
steel bath, is almost indescribable. Health is such an inestimable
blessing; it colours so highly the little picture of life; it sweetens so
exquisitely the small cup of our existence; it is so like sunshine, in
the absence of which the world, with all its beauties, would be, as
it once was, without form and void, that I can conceive nothing
which a man ought more eagerly to do than get between the stones
of that mill which is to grind him young again, particularly when,
as in my case, the operation was to be attended with no pain.
When, therefore, I had once left my hof to walk to the bath, I
felt as if no power on earth could arrest my progress.</p>

<p>The oblong slated building, which contains the famous waters of
Langen-Schwalbach, is plain and unassuming in its elevation, and
very sensibly adapted to its purpose. The outside walls are plastered,
and coloured a very light red. There are five-and-twenty
windows in front, with an arcade or covered walk beneath them,
supported by an equal number of pilasters, connected together by
Saxon arches. On entering the main door, which is in the centre,
the great staircase is immediately in front, and close to it, on the
left, there sits a man, from whom the person about to bathe purchases
his ticket, for which he pays forty-eight kreuzers, about sixteen
pence.</p>

<p>The Pauline spring is conducted to the baths on the upper story;
the Wein brunnen supplies those below on the left of the staircase;
the strong Stahl, or steel brunnen, those on the right; all these
baths opening into passages, which, in both stories, extend the
whole length of the building. At the commencement of each hour,
there was always a great bustle between the people about to be
washed, and those who had just undergone the operation. A man
and woman attend above and below, and, quite regardless of their
sex, every person was trying to prevail upon either of these attendants
to let the old water out of the bath, and to turn the hot and
cold cocks which were to replenish it. Restlessness and anxiety
were depicted in every countenance; however, in a few minutes,
a calm having ensued, the water was heard rushing into fifteen or
sixteen baths on each floor. Soon again the poor pair were badgered
and tormented by various voices, from trebles down to
contra-bassos, all calling to them to stop the cocks. With a thermometer
in one hand, a great wooden shovel in the other, and a
face as wet as if it had just emerged from the bath, each servant
hurried from one bath to another, adjusting them all to about 25°
of Reaumur. Door after door was then heard to shut, and in a few
minutes the passage became once again silent. A sort of wicker
basket, containing a pan of burning embers, was afterwards given
to any person who, for the sake of having warm towels, was
willing to breathe carbonic acid gas.</p>

<p>As soon as the patient was ready to enter his bath, the first
feeling which crossed his mind, as he stood shivering on the brink,
was a disinclination to dip even the foot into a mixture which looked
about as thick as a horse-pond, and about the colour of mullagitawny
soup. However, having come as far as Langen-Schwalbach,
there was nothing to say, but &ldquo;<i>en avant</i>,&rdquo; and so, descending the
steps, I got into stuff so deeply coloured with the red oxide of iron,
that the body, when a couple of inches below the surface, was invisible.
The temperature of the water felt neither hot nor cold;
but I was no sooner immersed in it, than I felt it was evidently of
a strengthening, bracing nature, and I could almost have fancied
myself lying with a set of hides in a tan-pit. The half-hour, which
every day I was sentenced to spend in this red decoction, was by
far the longest in the twenty-four hours; and I was always very
glad when my chronometer, which I always hung on a nail before
my eyes, pointed permission to me to extricate myself from the mess.
While the body was floating, hardly knowing whether to sink or
swim, I found it was very difficult for the mind to enjoy any sort
of recreation, or to reflect for two minutes on any one subject; and
as half shivering I lay watching the minute hand of the dial, it appeared
the slowest traveller in existence.</p>

<p>These baths are said to be very apt to produce head-ache, sleepiness,
and other slightly apoplectic symptoms; but surely such
effects must proceed from the silly habit of not immersing the head?
The frame of man has beneficently been made capable of existing
under the line, or near either of the poles of the earth. We know
it can even live in an oven in which meat is baking; but, surely, if
it were possible to send one half of the body to Iceland while the
other was reclining on the banks of Fernando Po, the trial would
be exceedingly severe; in as much as nature, never having contemplated
such a vagary, has not thought it necessary to provide
against it. In a less degree, the same argument applies to bathing,
particularly in mineral waters; for even the common pressure of
water on the portion of the body which is immersed in it, tends
mechanically to push or force the blood towards that part (the head)
enjoying a rarer medium; but when it is taken into calculation that
the mineral mixture of Schwalbach acts on the body not only mechanically,
by pressure, but medicinally, being a very strong astringent,
there needs no wizard to account for the unpleasant
sensations so often complained of.</p>

<p>For the above reason, I resolved that my head should fare alike
with the rest of my system; in short, that it deserved to be strengthened
as much as my limbs. It was equally old&mdash;had accompanied
them in all their little troubles; and, moreover, often and
often, when they had sunk down to rest, had it been forced to contemplate
and provide for the dangers and vicissitudes of the next
day. I, therefore, applied no half remedy&mdash;submitted to no partial
operation&mdash;but resolved that, if the waters of Langen-Schwalbach
were to make me invulnerable, the box which held my brains should
humbly, but equally, partake of the blessing.</p>

<p>The way in which I bathed, with the reasons which induced me
to do so, were mentioned to Dr. Fenner. He made no objection,
but in silence shrugged up his shoulders. However, the fact is, in
this instance, as well as in many others, he is obliged to prescribe
no more than human nature is willing to comply with. And as
Germans are not much in the habit of washing their heads,&mdash;and
even if they were, as they would certainly refuse to dip their sculls
into a mixture which stains the hair a deep-red-colour, upon which
common soap has not the slightest detergent effect,&mdash;the doctor
probably feels that he would only lose his influence were he publicly
to undergo the defeat of being driven from a system which
all men would agree to abominate; indeed, one has only to look at
the ladies&rsquo; flannel dresses which hang in the yard to dry, to read
the truth of the above assertion.</p>

<p>These garments having been several times immersed in the bath,
are stained as deep a red as if they had been rubbed with ochre or
brickdust; yet the upper part of the flannel is quite as white, and,
indeed, by comparison, appears infinitely whiter than ever: in short,
without asking to see the owners, it is quite evident that, at Schwalbach,
young ladies, and even old ones, cannot make up their minds
to stain any part of their fabric which towers above their evening
gowns; and, though the rest of their lovely persons are as red as
the limbs of the American Indian, yet their faces and cheeks bloom
like the roses of York and Lancaster; but the effect of these waters
on the skin is so singular, that one has only to witness it to understand
that it would be useless for the poor doctor to prescribe to
ladies more than a pie-bald application of the remedy.</p>

<p>Although, of course, in coming out of the bath, the patient rubs
himself dry, and apparently perfectly clean, yet the rust, by exercise,
comes out so profusely, that not only is the linen of those people
who bathe stained, but even their sheets are similarly discoloured;
the dandy&rsquo;s neckcloth becomes red; and when the head has been
immersed, the pillow in the morning looks as if a rusty thirteen-inch
shell had been reposing on it.</p>

<p>To the servant who has cleaned the bath, filled it, and supplied
it with towels, it is customary to give each day six kreuzers, amounting
to twopence; and, as another example of the cheapness of German
luxuries, I may observe, that, if a person chooses, instead of
walking, to be carried in a sedan-chair, and brought back to his
hof, the price fixed for the two journeys is&mdash;threepence.</p>

<p>Having now taken my bath, the next part of my daily sentence was,
&ldquo;to return to the place from whence I came, and there&rdquo; to drink
two more glasses of water from the Pauline. The weather having
been unusually hot, in walking to the bath I was generally very much
overpowered by the heat of the sun; but on leaving the mixture to
walk to the Pauline, I always felt as if his rays were not as strong
as myself; I really fancied that they glanced from my frame as from
a polished cuirass; and, far from suffering, I enjoyed the walk, always
remarking that the cold evaporation proceeding from wet hair formed
an additional reason for preventing the blood from rushing upwards.
The glass of cold sparkling water which, under the mid-day
sun, I received after quitting the bath, from the healthy-looking
old goddess of the Pauline, was delicious beyond the powers of
description. It was infinitely more refreshing than iced soda water,
and the idea that it was doing good instead of harm&mdash;that it was
medicine, not luxury&mdash;added to it a flavour which the mind, as well
as the body, seemed to enjoy.</p>

<p>What with the iron in my skin, the rust in my hair, and the
warmth which this strengthening mixture imparted to my waistcoat,
I always felt an unconquerable inclination to face the hill; and selecting
a different path from the one I had taken in the morning, I
seldom stopped until I had reached the tip-top of one of the many
eminences which overhang the promenade and its <i>beau monde</i>.</p>

<p>The climate of this high table-land was always invigorating; and
although the sun was the same planet which was scorching the
saunterers in the valley beneath, yet its rays did not take the same
hold upon the rare, subtile mountain air.</p>

<p>At this hour the peasants had descended into the town to dine.
The fields were, consequently, deserted; yet it was pleasing to see
where they had been toiling, and how much of the corn they had
cut since yesterday. I derived pleasure from looking at the large
heap of potatoes they had been extracting, and from observing that
they had already begun to plough the stubble which only two days
ago had been standing corn. Though neither man, woman, nor
child were to be seen, it was, nevertheless, quite evident that they
could only just have vanished; and though I had no fellow-creature
to converse with, yet I enjoyed an old-fashioned pleasure in tracing
on the ground marks where, at least, human beings had been.</p>

<p>Quite by myself I was loitering on these heights, when I heard the
troop of Langen-Schwalbach cows coming through the great wood
on my left; and wanting, at the moment, something to do, diving
into the forest I soon succeeded in joining the gang. They were
driven by a man and a woman, who received for every cow under
their care forty-two kreuzers, or fourteen pence, for the six summer
months: for this humble remuneration, they drove the cows
of Schwalbach every morning into the great woods, to enjoy air
and a very little food; three times a-day they conducted them home
to be milked, and as often re-ascended to the forest. At the hours
of assembling, the man blew a long, crooked, tin horn, which the
cows and their proprietors equally well understood. Everybody
must be aware, that it is not a very easy job to keep a set of cows
together in a forest, as the young ones, especially, are always endeavouring
to go astray; however, the two guides had each a curious
sort of instrument by which they managed to keep them in
excellent subjection. It consisted of a heavy stick about two feet
long, with six iron rings, so placed that they could be shaken up
and down; and, certainly, if it were to be exhibited at Smithfield,
no being there, human or inhuman, would ever guess that it was
invented for driving cows; and were he even to be told so, he
would not conceive how it could possibly be used for that purpose.
Yet, in Nassau, it is the regular engine for propelling cattle of all
descriptions.</p>

<p>In driving the cows through the wood, I observed that the man
and woman each kept on one flank, the herd leisurely proceeding
before them; but if any of the cows attempted to stray&mdash;if any of
them presumed to lie down&mdash;or if any one of them appeared to be
in too earnest conversation with a great lumbering creature of her
own species, distinguished by a ring through his nose, and a bright
iron chain round his neck, the man, and especially the woman,
gave two or three shakes with the ring, and if that lecture was not
sufficient the stick, rings and all, flew through the air, inflicting a
blow which really appeared sufficient to break a rib, and certainly
much more than sufficient to dislodge an eye.</p>

<p>It was easy to calculate the force of this uncouth weapon, by
the fear the poor animals entertained of it; and I observed, that no
sooner did the woman shake it at an erring, disobedient cow, than
the creature at once gave up the point, and hurried forwards.</p>

<p>In the stillness of the forest, nothing could sound wilder than the
sudden rattling of these rings, and almost could one fancy that
beings in chains were running between the trees. A less severe
discipline would, probably, not be sufficient. However, I must
record that the severity was exercised with a considerable proportion
of discretion; for I particularly remarked that, when cows
were in a certain interesting situation, their rude drivers, with unerring
aim, always pelted them on the hocks.</p>

<p>Leaving the cows, and descending the mountain&rsquo;s side, I strolled
through the little mountain hamlet of Wambach. In the middle of
this simple retreat, there stood, overtopping most of the other
dwellings, a tall slender hut, on the thatched roof of which was a
wooden pent-house, containing a bell, which, three times a-day,
tolled for reveille, noon-tide meal, and curfew. As the human
tongue speaks by the impulse of the mind, so did this humble clapper
move in obedience to the dictates of <i>a village watch</i>, which,
when out of order, the parish was bound to repair.</p>

<p>From the upper windows of the principal house, I saw suspended
festoons, or strings of apples cut in slices, and exposed to
the sun to dry. A lad, smoking his pipe, was driving his mother&rsquo;s
cow to fetch grass from the valley. Women, with pails in their
hands, were proceeding towards the spring for water; others were
returning to their homes heavily laden with fagots, while several of
their idle children were loitering about before their doors.</p>

<p>But, as I had still another dose of water to drink from the Pauline,
I hastened to the brunnen, and having emptied my glass
(which, like the outside of a bottle of iced water, was instantaneously
covered by condensation with dew), I found that it was time
to prepare myself (as I beg leave to prepare my reader) for that
very lengthy ceremony&mdash;a German dinner.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div>
<h2><a name="THE_DINNER" id="THE_DINNER">THE DINNER.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the fashionable season at Langen-Schwalbach, the dinner
hour at all the Saals is one o'clock. From about noon scarcely
a stranger is to be seen; but a few minutes before the bell strikes
one, the town exhibits a picture curious enough, when it is contrasted
with the simple costume of the villagers, and the wild-looking
country which surrounds them. From all the hofs and lodging-houses,
a set of demure, quiet-looking, well-dressed people are
suddenly disgorged, who, at a sort of funeral pace, slowly advance
towards the Allee Saal, the Goldene Kette, the Kaiser Saal, and
one or two other houses, <i>où l'on dîne</i>. The ladies are not dressed
in bonnets, but in caps, most of which are quiet; the rest being of
those indescribable shapes which are to be seen in London or
Paris. Whether the stiff-stand-up frippery of bright-red ribands
was meant to represent a house on fire, or purgatory itself&mdash;whether
those immense white ornaments were intended for reefs of
coral or not&mdash;it is out of my department to guess&mdash;ladies&rsquo; caps
being riddles only to be explained by themselves.</p>

<p>With no one to affront them&mdash;with no fine-powdered footman to
attend them&mdash;with nothing but their appetites to direct them&mdash;and
with their own quiet conduct to protect them&mdash;old ladies, young
ladies, elderly gentlemen, and young ones, were seen slowly and
silently picking their way over the rough pavement. There was
no greediness in their looks; nor, as they proceeded, did they lick
their lips, or show any other signs of possessing any appetite at all;
they looked much more as if they were coming from a meal, than
going to one: in short, they seemed to be thinking of anything in
the dictionary but the word <i>dinner</i>. And when one contrasted or
weighed the quietness of their demeanour, against the enormous
quantity of provisions they were placidly about to consume, one
could not help admitting that these Germans had certainly more
self-possession, and could better muzzle their feelings, than many
of the best-behaved people in the universe.</p>

<p>Seated at the table of the Allee Saal, I counted a hundred and
eighty people at dinner in one room. To say, in a single word, whether
the fare was good or bad, would be quite impossible, it being
so completely different to anything ever met with in England.</p>

<p>To my simple taste, the cooking is most horrid; still there were
now and then some dishes, particularly sweet ones, which I thought
excellent. With respect to the made-dishes, of which there was a
great variety, I beg to offer to the reader a formula I invented,
which will teach him (should he ever come to Germany) what to
expect. The simple rule is this:&mdash;let him taste the dish, and if it
be not sour, he may be quite certain that it is greasy;&mdash;again, if it
be not greasy, let him not eat thereof, for then it is sure to be sour.
With regard to the order of the dishes, that, too, is unlike any thing
which Mrs. Glasse ever thought of. After soup, which all over the
world is the alpha of the gourmand&rsquo;s alphabet, the barren meat
from which the said soup has been extracted is produced. Of
course it is dry, tasteless, withered-looking stuff, which a Grosvenor-square
cat would not touch with its whisker; but this dish is
always attended by a couple of satellites&mdash;the one a quantity of cucumbers
dressed in vinegar, the other a black, greasy sauce; and if
you dare to accept a piece of this flaccid beef, you are instantly
thrown between Scylla and Charybdis; for so sure as you decline
the indigestible cucumber, souse comes into your plate a deluge of
the greasy sauce! After the company have eaten heavily of messes
which it would be impossible to describe, in comes some nice salmon&mdash;then
fowls&mdash;then puddings&mdash;then meat again&mdash;then stewed
fruit; and after the English stranger has fallen back in his chair
quite beaten, a leg of mutton majestically makes its appearance!</p>

<p>I dined just two days at the Saals, and then bade adieu to them
for ever. Nothing which this world affords could induce me to
feed in this gross manner. The pig, who lives in his sty, would
have some excuse; but it is really quite shocking to see any other
animal overpowering himself at mid-day with such a mixture and
superabundance of food. Yet only think what a compliment all
this is to the mineral waters of Langen-Schwalbach; for if people
who come here and live in this way morning, noon, and night can,
as I really believe they do, return to their homes in better health
than they departed, how much more benefit ought any one to derive,
who, maintaining a life of simplicity and temperance, would
resolve to give them a fair trial! In short, if the cold iron waters
of the Pauline can be of real service to a stomach full of vinegar
and grease, how much more effectually ought they to tinker up and
repair the inside of him who has sense enough to sue them <i>in
formâ pauperis</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Fenner was told that I had given up dining in public, as I
preferred a single dish at home; and he was then asked, with a
scrutinizing look, whether eating so much was not surely very bad
for those who were drinking the waters? The poor doctor quietly
shrugged up his shoulders,&mdash;silently looking at his shoes,&mdash;and
what else could he have done? Himself an inhabitant of Langen-Schwalbach,
of course he was obliged to feel the pulse of his own
fellow-citizens, as well as that of the stranger; and into what a
fever would he have thrown all the innkeepers&mdash;what a convulsion
would he have occasioned in the village itself&mdash;were he to
have presumed to prescribe temperance to those wealthy visiters
by whose intemperance the community hoped to prosper! He
might as well have gone into the fields to burn the crops, as thus
wickedly to blight the golden harvest which Langen-Schwalbach
had calculated on reaping during the short visit of its consumptive
guests.</p>

<p>Our dinner is now over; but I must not rise from the table of
the Allee Saal until I have made an '<i>amende honorable</i>' to those
against whose vile cooking I have been railing, for it is only common
justice to German society to offer an humble testimony that
nothing can be more creditable to any nation; one can scarcely
imagine a more pleasing picture of civilized life, than the mode in
which society is conducted at these watering-places.</p>

<p>The company which comes to the brunnens for health, and which
daily assembles at dinner, is of a most heterogeneous description,
being composed of Princes, Dukes, Barons, Counts, &amp;c., down to
the petty shopkeeper, and even the Jew of Frankfort, Mainz, and
other neighbouring towns; in short, all the most jarring elements
of society, at the same moment, enter the same room, to partake
together the same one shilling and eight-penny dinner.</p>

<p>Even to a stranger like myself, it was easy to perceive that the
company, as they seated themselves round the table, had herded
together in parties and coteries, neither acquainted with each
other, nor with much disposition to be acquainted&mdash;still, all those
invaluable forms of society which connect the guests of any private
individual were most strictly observed; and, from the natural good
sense and breeding in the country this happy combination was apparently
effected without any effort. No one seemed to be under
any restraint, yet there was no freezing formality at one end of the
table, nor rude boisterous mirth at the other. With as honest good
appetites as could belong to any set of people under the sun, I particularly
remarked that there was no scrambling for favourite
dishes;&mdash;to be sure, here and there, an eye was seen twinkling a
little brighter than usual, as it watched the progress of any approaching
dish which appeared to be unusually sour or greasy,
but there was no greediness&mdash;no impatience&mdash;nothing which
seemed for a single moment to interrupt the general harmony of the
scene; and, though I scarcely heard a syllable of the buzz of conversation
which surrounded me; although every moment I felt less
and less disposed to attempt to eat what for some time had gradually
been coagulating in my plate; yet, leaning back in my chair, I certainly
did derive very great pleasure, and I hope a very rational
enjoyment, in looking upon so pleasing a picture of civilized life.</p>

<p>In England we are too apt to designate, by the general term
&ldquo;society,&rdquo; the particular class, clan, or clique in which we ourselves
may happen to move, and if that little speck be sufficiently polished,
people are generally quite satisfied with what they term &ldquo;the
present state of society;&rdquo; yet there exists a very important difference
between this ideal civilization of a part or parts of a community,
and the actual civilization of the community as a whole:
and surely no country can justly claim for itself that title, until not
only can its various members move separately among each other,
but until, if necessary, they can all meet and act together. Now,
if this assertion be admitted, I fear it cannot be denied that we
islanders are very far from being as highly polished as our continental
neighbours, and that we but too often mistake odd provincial
habits of our own invention, for the broad, useful, current manners
of the world.</p>

<p>In England, each class of society, like our different bands of
trades, is governed by its own particular rules. There is a class
of society which has very gravely, and for aught I care very
properly, settled that certain food is to be eaten with a fork&mdash;that
others are to be launched into the mouth with a spoon; and that
to act against these rules (or whims) shows &ldquo;that the man has
not lived in <i>the world</i>.&rdquo; At the other end of society there are, one
has heard, also rules of honour, prescribing the sum to be put into
a tin money-box, so often as the pipe shall be filled with tobacco,
with various other laws of the same dark caste or complexion.
These conventions, however, having been firmly established among
each of the many classes into which our country people are subdivided,
a very considerable degree of order is everywhere maintained;
and, therefore, let a foreigner go into any sort of society in
England, and he will find it is apparently living in happy obedience
to its own laws; but if any chance or convulsion brings these various
classes of society, each laden with its own laws, into general
contact, a sort of Babel confusion instantly takes place, each class
loudly calling its neighbour to order in a language it cannot comprehend.
Like the followers of different religions, the one has been
taught a creed which has not even been heard of by the other;
there is no sound bond of union&mdash;no reasonable understanding
between the parties: in short, they resemble a set of regiments,
each of which having been drilled according to the caprice or fancy
of its colonel, appears in very high order on its own parade, yet,
when all are brought together, form an unorganized and undisciplined
army; and in support of this theory, is it not undeniably
true, that it is practically impossible for all ranks of society to associate
together in England with the same ease and inoffensive
freedom which characterizes similar meetings on the Continent?
And yet a German duke or a German baron is as proud of his
rank, and rank is as much respected in his country as it is in our
country.</p>

<p>There <i>must</i>, therefore, in England exist somewhere or other a
radical fault. The upper classes will of course lay the blame on
the lowest&mdash;the lowest will abuse the highest&mdash;but may not the
error lie between the two? Does it not rather rest upon both?
and is it not caused by the laws which regulate our small island society
being odd, unmeaning, imaginary, and often fictitious, instead
of being stamped with those large intelligible characters which
make them at once legible to all the inhabitants of the globe?</p>

<p>For instance, on the Continent, every child, almost before he
learns his alphabet, before he is able even to crack a whip, is
taught what is termed in Europe civility; a trifling example of
which I witnessed this very morning. At nearly a league from
Langen-Schwalbach, I walked up to a little boy who was flying
a kite on the top of a hill, in the middle of a field of oat stubble.
I said not a word to the child&mdash;scarcely looked at him&mdash;but as soon
as I got close to him, the little village clod, who had never breathed
anything thicker than his own mountain air, actually almost lost
string, kite, and all, in an effort, quite irresistible, which he made
to bow to me, and take off his hat. Again, in the middle of the
forest, I saw the other day three labouring boys laughing together,
each of their mouths being, if possible, wider open than the others;
however, as they separated, off went their caps, and they really
took leave of each other in the very same sort of manner with
which I yesterday saw the Landgrave of Hesse Hombourg return
a bow to a common postilion.</p>

<p>It is this general, well founded, and acknowledged system which
binds together all classes of society. It is this useful, sensible
system, which enables the master of the Allee Saal, as he walks about
the room during dinner time, occasionally to converse with the
various descriptions of guests who have honoured his table with
their presence; for, however people in England would be shocked
at such an idea, on the Continent, so long as a person speaks and
behaves correctly, he need not fear to give any one offence.</p>

<p>Now, in England, as we all know, we have all sorts of manners,
and a man actually scarcely dares to say which is the true idol to
be worshipped. We have very noble aristocratic manners;&mdash;we
have the short, stumpy manners of the old-fashioned English
country gentleman;&mdash;we have thick, dandified manners;&mdash;blackstock
military manners;&mdash;&ldquo;your free and easy manners&rdquo; (which,
by the by, on the Continent, would be translated &ldquo;<i>no manners at
all</i>.&rdquo;) We have the ledger manners of a steady man of business;&mdash;the
last-imported monkey or ultra-Parisian manners;&mdash;manners
not only of a school-boy, but of the particular school to which
he belongs;&mdash;and, lastly, we have the party-coloured manners
of the mobility, who, until they were taught the contrary, very
falsely flattered themselves that on the throne they would find the
&ldquo;ship, a-hoy!&rdquo; manners of &ldquo;a true British sailor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, with respect to these motley manners, these &ldquo;black spirits
and white, blue spirits and grey,&rdquo; which are about as different from
each other as the manners of the various beasts collected by Noah in
his ark, it may at once be observed, that (however we ourselves
may admire them) there are very few of them indeed which are
suited to the Continent; and consequently, though Russians, Prussians,
Austrians, French, and Italians, to a certain degree, can anywhere
assimilate together, yet, somehow or other, our manners&mdash;(never
mind whether better or worse)&mdash;are different. Which,
therefore, I am seriously disposed to ask of myself, are the most
likely to be right? the manners of &ldquo;the right little, tight little island,&rdquo;
or those of the inhabitants of the vast Continent of Europe?</p>

<p>The reader will, I fear, think that my dinner reflections have
partaken of the acidity of the German mess which lay so long before
me untouched in my plate; and at my observations I fully expect
he will shake his head, as I did when, afterwards, expecting to get
something sweet, I found my mouth nearly filled with a substance
very nearly related to sour-crout. Should the old man&rsquo;s remarks
be unpalatable, they are not more so than was his meal; and he
begs to apologize for them by saying, that had he, as he much
wished, been able to eat, he would not, against his will, have been
driven to reflect.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PROMENADE" id="THE_PROMENADE">THE PROMENADE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> minutes after the dessert had been placed on the table of
the Allee Saal, one or two people from different chairs rose and
glided away; then up got as many more, until, in about a quarter of
an hour, the whole company had quietly vanished, excepting here
and there, round the vast circumference of the table, a couple, who,
not having yet finished their phlegmatic, long-winded argument,
sat like pairs of oxen, with their heads yoked together.</p>

<p>It being yet only three o'clock in the day, and as people did not
begin to drink the waters again till about six, there was a long,
heavy interval, which was spent very much in the way in which
English cows pass their time when quite full of fine red clover,&mdash;bending
their fore knees, they lie down on the grass to ruminate.</p>

<p>As it was very hot at this hour, the ladies, in groups of two,
three, and four, with coffee before them on small square tables, sat
out together in the open air, under the shade of the trees. Most
of them commenced knitting; but, at this plethoric hour, I could not
help observing that they made several hundred times as many
stitches as remarks. A few of the young men, with cigars in their
mouths, meandered, in dandified silence, through these parties of
ladies; but almost all the German lords of the creation had hidden
themselves in holes and corners, to enjoy smoking their pipes; and
surely nothing can be more filthy&mdash;nothing can be a greater waste
of time and intellect than this horrid habit. If tobacco were even
a fragrant perfume, instead of stinking as it does, still the habit
which makes it necessary to a human being to carry a large bag in
one of his coat-pockets, and an unwieldy crooked pipe in the other,
would be unmanly; inasmuch as, besides creating an artificial
want, it encumbers him with a real burden, which, both on horseback
and on foot, impedes his activity and his progress; but when
it turns out that this sad artificial want is a nasty, vicious habit,&mdash;when
it is impossible to be clean if you indulge in it,&mdash;when
it makes your hair and clothes smell most loathsomely,&mdash;when you
absolutely pollute the fresh air as you pass through it:&mdash;when,
besides all this, it corrodes the teeth, injures the stomach, and fills
with red inflammatory particles the naturally cool, clear, white
brain of man, it is quite astonishing that these Germans, who can
act so sensibly during so many hours of the day, should not have
strength of mind enough to trample their tobacco-bags under their
feet&mdash;throw their reeking, sooty pipes behind them, and learn (I
will not say from the English, but from every bird and animal in a
state of nature) to be clean; and certainly whatever faults there
may be in our manners, our cleanliness is a virtue which, above
every nation I have ever visited, pre-eminently distinguishes us in
the world. During the time which was spent in this stinking vice,
I observed that people neither interrupted each other, nor did they
very much like to be interrupted; in short, it was a sort of siesta
with the eyes open, and with smoke coming out of the mouth.
Sometimes gazing out of the window of his hof, I saw a German
baron, in a tawdry dressing-gown and scullcap (with an immense
ring on his dirty forefinger), smoking, and pretending to be thinking;
sometimes I winded a creature who, in a similar attitude, was
seated on the shady benches near the Stahl brunnen; but these
were only exceptions to the general rule, for most of the males had
vanished, one knew not where, to convert themselves into automatons
which had all the smoky nuisance of the steam-engine&mdash;without
its power.</p>

<p>At about half-past five or six o'clock, &ldquo;the world&rdquo; began to
come to life again; the ladies with their knitting needles lying in
their laps, gradually began to talk to each other, some even attempting
to laugh. Group rising after group, left the small white
painted tables and empty coffee-cups round which they had been
sitting, and in a short time, the walks to the three brunnens in general,
and to the Pauline in particular, were once again thronged
with people; and as slowly, and very slowly, they walked backwards
and forwards, one again saw German society in its most
amiable and delightful point of view. A few of the ladies, particularly
those who had young children, were occasionally accompanied
through the day by a nice steady, healthy-looking young woman,
whose dress (being without cap or bonnet, with a plain cloth shawl
thrown over a dark cotton gown) at once denoted that she was a
servant.</p>

<p>The distinction in her dress was marked in the extreme, yet it
was pleasing to see that there was no necessity to carry it farther,
the woman appearing to be so well behaved, that there was little
fear of her giving offence. Whenever her mistress stopped to talk
to any of her friends, this attendant became a harmless listener to
the conversation, and when a couple of families, seated on a bank,
were amusing each other with jokes and anecdotes, one saw by
the countenances of these quiet-looking young people, who were
also permitted to sit down, that they were enjoying the story quite
as much as the rest.</p>

<p>In England, our fine people would of course be shocked at the
idea of thus associating with, or rather sitting in society with their
servants, and on account of the manners of our servants, it certainly
would not be agreeable; however, if we had but one code,
instead of having one hundred and fifty thousand (for I quite
forgot to insert in my long list the manners of a fashionable lady&rsquo;s
maid), this would not be the case; for then English servants, like
German servants, would learn to sit in the presence of their superiors
without giving any offence at all. But besides observing how
harmlessly these German menials conducted themselves, I must
own I could not help reflecting what an advantage it was, not
only to them, but to the humble hovel to which, when they married,
they would probably return&mdash;in short, to society, that they should
thus have had an opportunity of witnessing the conduct, and of
listening to the conversation of quiet, sensible, moral people, who
had had the advantages of a good education.</p>

<p>Of course, if these young people were placed on high wages&mdash;tricked
out with all the cast-off finery of their mistresses&mdash;and if
laden with these elements of corruption, and hopelessly banished
from the presence of their superiors, they were day after day, and
night after night, to be stewed up together with stewards, butlers, &amp;c.,
in the devil&rsquo;s frying-pan&mdash;I mean, that den of narrow-minded iniquity,
a housekeeper&rsquo;s room&mdash;of course, these strong, bony, useful
servants would very soon dress as finely, and give themselves all
those airs for which an English lady&rsquo;s maid is so celebrated even
in her own country; but, in Germany, good sense and poverty
have as yet firmly and rigidly prescribed, not only the dress which
is to distinguish servants from their masters, but that, with every
rational indulgence, with every liberal opportunity of raising
themselves in their own estimation, they shall be fed and treated
in a manner and according to a scale, which, though superior, still
bears a due relation to the humble station and habits in which they
were born and bred. Of course, servants trained in this manner
cost very little, yet if they are not naturally ill-disposed, there is
every thing to encourage them in good behaviour, with very little
to lead them astray. They are certainly not, like our servants,
clothed in satin, fine linen, and superfine cloth; nor like Dives
himself, do they fare sumptuously every day, but I believe they are
all the happier, and infinitely more at their ease, for being kept to
their natural station in life, instead of being permitted to ape an
appearance for which their education has not fitted them, or repeat
fine slip-slop sentiments which they do not understand.</p>

<p>However, it is not our servants who deserve to be blamed; they
are quite right to receive high wages, wear veils, kid gloves, superfine
cloth, give themselves airs, mock the manners of their lords
and ladies, and to farcify below stairs the &ldquo;Comedy of Errors,&rdquo;
which they catch an occasional glimpse of above; in short, to do as
little, consume as much, and be as expensive and troublesome as
possible. No liberal person can blame <i>them</i>, but it is, I fear, on
<i>our</i> heads that all their follies must rest; we have no one but ourselves
to blame, and until a few of the principal families in England,
for the credit and welfare of the country, agree together to lower
the style and habits of their servants, and by a long pull, a strong
pull, and a pull all together, to break the horrid system which at
present prevails,&mdash;the distinction between the honest ploughman,
who whistles along the fallow, and his white-faced, powder-headed,
silver-laced, scarlet-breached, golden-gartered brother in
London, must be as strikingly ridiculous as ever: the one must remain
an honour, the other a discredit, to the wealth of a country
which (we all say unjustly) has been called by its enemy a &ldquo;nation
of shopkeepers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If once the system were to be blown up, thousands of honest,
well-meaning servants would, I believe, rejoice; and while the
aristocracy and wealthier classes would in fact be served at least
as well as ever, the middle ranks, and especially all people of small
incomes, would be relieved beyond description from an unnatural
and unnecessary burden which but too often embitters all their little
domestic arrangements. There can be no points of contrast between
Germany and England more remarkable than that, in the
one country, people of all incomes are supported and relieved in
proportion to the number of their servants, while in the other they
are tormented and oppressed. Again, that in the one country,
servants humbly dressed, and humbly fed, live in a sort of exalted
and honourable intercourse with their masters; while, in the other,
servants highly powdered, and grossly fed, are treated <i>de haut en
bas</i>, in a manner which is not to be seen on the Continent.</p>

<p>The enormous wealth of England is the commercial wonder of
the world, yet every reflecting man who looks at our debt, at the
immense fortunes of individuals, and at the levelling, unprincipled,
radical spirit of the age, must see that there exist among us elements
which may possibly some day or other furiously appear in
collision. The great country may yet live to see distress; and in
the storm, our commercial integrity, like an over weighted vessel,
may, for aught we know, founder and go down, stern foremost. I
therefore most earnestly say, should this calamity ever befall us,
let not foreigners be entitled, in preaching over our graves, to
pronounce, &ldquo;that we were a people who did not know how to enjoy
prosperity&mdash;that our money, like our blood, flew to our heads&mdash;that
our riches corrupted our minds&mdash;and that it was absolutely
our enormous wealth which sunk us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without saying one other word, I will only again ask, is it or is
it not the interest of our upper classes to countenance this island
system?</p>

<p>Should it be argued, that they ought not to be blamed because
vulgar, narrow-minded people are foolish enough to ruin themselves
in a vain attempt to copy them, I reply, that they must take
human nature, good and bad, not as it ought to be, but as it is; and
that, after all, it is no compliment to the high station they hold,
that the middle and lower classes will absolutely ruin themselves
in overfeeding and overdressing their servants&mdash;in short, in following
any bad example which such high authority may irrationally
decree to be fashionable. But to return to the Promenade.</p>

<p>From everlastingly vibrating backwards and forwards on this
walk, one gets so well acquainted with the faces of one&rsquo;s comrades,
that it is easy to note the arrival of any stranger, who, however,
after having made two or three turns, is considered as received
into, and belonging to, the ambulatory community.</p>

<p>In constantly passing the people on the promenade, one occasionally
heard a party talking French. During the military dominion
of Napoleon, that language, of course, flooded the whole of
the high duchy of Nassau as completely as almost the rest of Europe:
a strong ebb or re-action, however, has of late years taken
place, and in Prussia, for instance, the common people do not
like even to hear the language pronounced. On the other hand,
thanks to Sir Walter Scott, Lord Byron, and other worn-out
literary labourers, now resting in their graves, our language is
beginning to make an honest progress; and even in France it is
becoming fashionable to display in literary society a flower or two
culled from that North border, the Jardin Anglais.</p>

<p>As a passing stranger, the word I heard pronounced on the promenade
the oftenest was &ldquo;Ja! Ja!&rdquo; and it really seemed to me that
German women to all questions invariably answer in the affirmative,
for &ldquo;Ja! Ja!&rdquo; was repeated by them, I know, from morning till
night, and, for aught I know, from night till morning.</p>

<p>As almost every stranger at Langen-Schwalbach, as well as several
of its inhabitants, were at this hour on the promenade, the
three brunnens were often surrounded by more open mouths than
the women in attendance could supply. The old mother at the
Pauline was therefore always assisted in the evening by her daughter,
who, without being at all handsome, was, like her parent, a
picture of robust, ruddy health; and to poor withered people, who
came to them to drink, it was very satisfactory indeed to see the
practical effect which swallowing and baling out this water from
morning till night had had on these two females; and as they stood
in the burning sun bending downwards into the brunnen, to fill
the glasses which in all directions converged towards them, it was
curious to observe the different descriptions of people who from
every point of Europe (except England) had surrounded one little
well. As I earnestly looked at their various figures and faces, I
could not help feeling that it was quite impossible for the goddess
Pauline to cure them all: for I saw a tall, gaunt, brown, hard-featured,
lantern-jawed officer, <i>à demi-solde</i>, the sort of fellow that
the French call &ldquo;<i>un gros maigre</i>,&rdquo; drinking by the side of a red-faced,
stuffy, stumpy, stunted little man, who seemed made on purpose
to demonstrate that the human figure, like the telescope, could
be made portable.&mdash;What in the whole world (I mumbled to myself)
can be the matter with that very nice, fresh, comfortable,
healthy-looking widow? Or what does that huge, unwieldy man
in the broad-brimmed hat require from the Pauline?&mdash;Surely he is
already about as full as he can hold? And that poor sick girl,
who has just borrowed the glass from her withered, wrinkled,
skinny, little aunt? Can the same prescription be good for them
both? A couple of nicely-dressed children are extending their little
glasses to drink the water with milk; and see! that gang of countrymen,
who have stopped their carts on the upper road, are racing
and chasing each other down the bank to crowd round the brunnen!
Is it not curious to observe that in such a state of perspiration
they can drink such deadly cold water with impunity? But this
really is the case; and whether it is burning hot, or raining a deluge,
this simple medicine is always agreeable, and no sooner is it
swallowed, than, like the fire in the grate, it begins to warm its
new mansion.</p>

<p>Such was the scene, and such was the effect, daily witnessed
round one of nature&rsquo;s simplest and most beneficent remedies. All
the drinkers seemed to be satisfied with the water, which, I believe,
has only one virtue, that of strengthening the stomach; yet it is this
solitary quality which has made it cure almost every possible disorder
of body and mind: for though people with an ankle resting on
a knee sometimes mysteriously point to their toes, and sometimes
as solemnly lay their hands upon their foreheads, yet I rather
believe that almost every malady to which the human frame is
subject is either by highways or byways connected with the
stomach; and I must own I never see a fashionable physician mysteriously
counting the pulse of a plethoric patient, or, with a silver
spoon on his tongue, importantly looking down his red, inflamed
gullet (so properly termed by Johnson &ldquo;the meat-pipe&rdquo;), but I
feel a desire to exclaim, &ldquo;Why not tell the poor gentleman at once&mdash;Sir!
you've eaten too much, you've drunk too much, and you've
not taken exercise enough!&rdquo; That these are the main causes of
almost every one&rsquo;s illness, there can be no greater proof, than that
those savage nations which live actively and temperately have only
one great disorder&mdash;death. The human frame was not created
imperfect&mdash;it is we ourselves who have made it so; there exists no
donkey in creation so overladen as our stomachs, and it is because
they groan under the weight so cruelly imposed upon them, that we
see people driving them before them in herds to drink at one little
brunnen.</p>

<p>A list of the strangers visiting Bad-Ems, Langen-Schwalbach,
and Schlangenbad, is published twice a week, and circulated on all
the promenades. From it, I find that there are 1200 visiters at
Schwalbach alone&mdash;an immense number for so small a place.
Still, the habits of the people are so quiet, that it does not at all
bear the appearance of an English watering-place, and certainly I
never before existed in a society where people are left so completely
to go their own ways. Whether I stroll up and down the
promenade or about the town, whether I mount the hill or ramble
into distant villages, no one seems to notice me any more than if I
had been born there; and yet out of the 1200 strangers, I happen
to be the only specimen to be seen of Old England. No one knows
that I have given up feasting in public, for it is not the custom to
dine always at the same house; but when one o'clock comes, people
go to the Allee Saal, Goldene Kette, &amp;c. just as they feel disposed
at the moment.</p>

<p>There are no horses to be hired at Schwalbach, but a profusion
of donkeys and mules. It is a pretty, gaudy sight to witness a
group of these animals carrying ladies in their parti-coloured bonnets,
&amp;c. descending one of the hills. The saddles are covered
with coarse scarlet, or bright blue cloth, and the donkey always
wears a fine red brow-band; nevertheless, under these brilliant colours,
to the eye of a cognoscente, it is too easy to perceive that
the poor creatures are sick in their hearts of their finery, and that
they are tired, almost unto death, of carrying one large curious lady
after another to see Hohenstein, Adolfseck, and other lions, which
without metaphor are actually consuming the carcasses of these
unhappy asses. The other day I myself hired one, but not being
allowed to have the animal alone, I was obliged to submit to be
followed by the owner, who, by order of the Duke, was dressed in
a blue smockfrock, girded by a buff belt.</p>

<p>I found that I could not produce the slightest effect on the animal&rsquo;s
pace, but that if the man behind me only shook his stick,
down went the creature&rsquo;s long ears, and on we trotted. By this
arrangement, I was hurried by objects which I wished to look at,
and obliged to crawl before what I was exceedingly anxious to
leave behind; and altogether it was travelling so very much like a
bag of sand, that ever since I have much preferred propelling
myself.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SCHWEIN-GENERAL" id="THE_SCHWEIN-GENERAL">THE SCHWEIN-GENERAL.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> morning at half-past five o'clock, I hear, as I am dressing,
the sudden blast of an immense long wooden horn, from which
always proceed the same four notes. I have got quite accustomed
to this wild reveille, and the vibration has scarcely subsided, it is
still ringing among the distant hills, when, leisurely proceeding from
almost every door in the street, behold a pig! Some, from their jaded,
careworn, dragged appearance, are evidently leaving behind them
a numerous litter; others are great, tall, monastic, melancholy-looking
creatures, which seem to have no other object left in this
wretched world than to become bacon; while others are thin, tiny,
light-hearted, brisk, petulant piglings, with the world and all its
loves and sorrows before them. Of their own accord these creatures
proceed down the street to join the herdsman, who occasionally
continues to repeat the sorrowful blast from his horn.</p>

<p>Gregarious, or naturally fond of society, with one curl in their
tails, and with their noses almost touching the ground, the pigs trot
on, grunting to themselves and to their comrades, halting only
whenever they come to anything they can manage to swallow.</p>

<p>I have observed that the old ones pass all the carcasses, which,
trailing to the ground, are hanging before the butchers&rsquo; shops, as
if they were on a sort of <i>parole d'honneur</i> not to touch them; the
middle-aged ones wistfully eye this meat, yet jog on also, while the
piglings, who (so like mankind) have more appetite than judgment,
can rarely resist taking a nibble; yet, no sooner does the dead calf
begin again to move, than from the window immediately above out
pops the head of a butcher, who, drinking his coffee, whip in hand,
inflicts a prompt punishment, sounding quite equal to the offence.
As I have stated, the pigs, generally speaking, proceed of their
own accord; but shortly after they have passed, there comes down
our street a little bareheaded, barefooted, stunted dab of a child,
about eleven years old,&mdash;a Flibbertigibbet sort of creature, which,
in a drawing, one would express by a couple of blots, the small
one for her head, the other for her body; while, streaming from
the latter, there would be a long line ending in a flourish, to express
the immense whip which the child carries in its hand. This
little goblin page, the whipper-in, attendant, or aid-de-camp of the
old pig-driver, facetiously called, at Langen-Schwalbach, the
&ldquo;Schwein-General,&rdquo; is a being no one looks at, and who looks at
nobody. Whether the hofs of Schwalbach are full of strangers,
or empty&mdash;whether the promenades are occupied by princes or
peasants&mdash;whether the weather be good or bad, hot or rainy, she
apparently never stops to consider; upon these insignificant subjects
it is evident she never for a moment has reflected. But such
a pair of eyes for a pig have perhaps seldom beamed from human
sockets! The little intelligent urchin knows every house from
which a pig ought to have proceeded; she can tell by the door
being open or shut, and even by footmarks, whether the creature
has joined the herd, or whether, having overslept itself, it is still
snoring in its sty&mdash;a single glance determines whether she shall
pass a yard or enter it; and if a pig, from indolence or greediness,
be loitering on the road, the sting of the wasp cannot be sharper
or more spiteful than the cut she gives it. As soon as finishing
with one street, she joins her General in the main road, the herd
slowly proceed down the town.</p>

<p>On meeting them this morning, they really appeared to have no
hams at all; their bodies were as flat as if they had been squeezed
in a vice, and when they turned sideways, their long sharp noses,
and tucked-up bellies, gave to their profile the appearance of
starved greyhounds.</p>

<p>As I gravely followed this grunting, unearthly-looking herd of
unclean spirits, through that low part of Langen-Schwalbach which
is solely inhabited by Jews, I could not help fancying that I observed
them holding their very breaths, as if a loathsome pestilence were
passing; for though fat pork be a wicked luxury&mdash;a forbidden
pleasure which the Jew has been supposed occasionally in secret
to indulge in, yet one may easily imagine that such very lean ugly
pigs have not charms enough to lead them astray.</p>

<p>Besides the little girl who brought up the rear, the herd was preceded
by a boy of about fourteen, whose duty it was not to let the
foremost, the more enterprising, or, in other words, the most empty
pigs, advance too fast. In the middle of the drove, surrounded
like a shepherd by his flock, slowly stalked the &ldquo;<em class="smcap">Schwein-general</em>,&rdquo;
a wan, spectre-looking old man, worn out, or nearly so, by the arduous
and every-day duty of conducting, against their wills, a gang
of exactly the most obstinate animals in creation. A single glance
at his jaundiced, ill-natured countenance was sufficient to satisfy
one that his temper had been soured by the vexatious contrarieties
and &ldquo;untoward events&rdquo; it had met with. In his left hand he held
a staff to help himself onwards, while round his right shoulder
hung one of the most terrific whips that could possibly be constructed.
At the end of a short handle, turning upon a swivel,
there was a lash about nine feet long, formed like the vertebræ of
a snake, each joint being an iron ring, which, decreasing in size,
was closely connected with its neighbour, by a band of hard greasy
leather. The pliability, the weight, and the force of this iron whip
rendered it an argument which the obstinacy even of the pig was
unable to resist; yet, as the old man proceeded down the town, he
endeavoured to speak kindly to the herd, and as the bulk of them
preceded him, jostling each other, grumbling and grunting on their
way, he occasionally exclaimed, in a low, hollow, worn-out tone of
encouragement, &ldquo;Nina! Anina!&rdquo; drawling of course very long on
the last syllable.</p>

<p>If any little savoury morsel caused a contention, stoppage, or
constipation on the march, the old fellow slowly unwound his dreadful
whip, and by merely whirling it round his head, like reading the
Riot Act, he generally succeeded in dispersing the crowd; but if
they neglected the solemn warning, if their stomachs prove stronger
than their judgments, and if the group of greedy pigs still continued
to stagnate&mdash;&ldquo;<em class="smcap">Arriff!</em>&rdquo; the old fellow exclaimed, and rushing forwards,
the lash whirling round his head, he inflicted, with strength
which no one could have fancied he possessed, a smack, that
seemed absolutely to electrify the leader. As lightning shoots
across the heavens, I observed the culprit fly forwards, and for
many yards continuing to sidle towards the left, it was quite evident
that the thorn was still smarting in his side; and no wonder,
poor fellow! for the blow he received would almost have cut
a piece out of a door.</p>

<p>As soon as the herd got out of the town, they began gradually
to ascend the rocky, barren mountain which appeared towering
above them; and then the labours of the Schwein-general and his
staff became greater than ever; for as the animals from their solid
column began to extend or deploy themselves into line, it was necessary
constantly to ascend and descend the slippery hill, in order
to outflank them. &ldquo;<em class="smcap">Arriff</em>!&rdquo; vociferated the old man, striding after
one of his rebellious subjects; &ldquo;Arriff!&rdquo; in a shrill tone of voice
was re-echoed by the lad, as he ran after another; however, in
due time the drove reached the ground which was devoted for that
day&rsquo;s exercise, the whole mountain being thus taken in regular
succession.</p>

<p>The Schwein-general now halted, and the pigs being no longer
called upon to advance, but being left entirely to their own motions,
I became exceedingly anxious attentively to observe them.</p>

<p>No wonder, poor reflecting creatures! that they had come unwillingly
to such a spot&mdash;for there appeared to be literally nothing
for them to eat but hot stones and dust; however, making the best
of the bargain, they all very vigorously set themselves to work.
Looking up the hill, they dexterously began to lift up with their
snouts the largest of the loose stones, and then grubbing their noses
into the cool ground, I watched their proceedings for a very long
time. Their tough wet snouts seemed to be sensible of the quality
of every thing they touched; and thus out of the apparently barren
ground they managed to get fibres of roots, to say nothing of worms,
beetles, or any other travelling insects they met with. As they
slowly advanced working up the hill, their ears most philosophically
shading their eyes from the hot sun, I could not help feeling
how little we appreciate the delicacy of several of their senses, and
the extreme acuteness of their instinct.</p>

<p>There exists, perhaps, in creation, no animal which has less justice
and more injustice done to him by man than the pig. Gifted
with every faculty of supplying himself, and of providing even
against the approaching storm, which no creature is better capable
of foretelling than a pig, we begin by putting an iron ring through
the cartilage of his nose, and having thus barbarously deprived him
of the power of searching for, and analyzing, his food, we generally
condemn him for the rest of his life to solitary confinement
in a sty.</p>

<p>While his faculties are still his own, only observe how, with a
bark or snort, he starts if you approach him, and mark what
shrewd intelligence there is in his bright twinkling little eye: but
with pigs, as with mankind, idleness is the root of all evil. The
poor animal finding that he has absolutely nothing to do&mdash;having no
enjoyment&mdash;nothing to look forward to but the pail which feeds
him, naturally most eagerly, or, as we accuse him, most greedily,
greets its arrival. Having no natural business or diversion&mdash;nothing
to occupy his brain&mdash;the whole powers of his system are
directed to the digestion of a superabundance of food. To encourage
this, nature assists him with sleep, which, lulling his better faculties,
leads his stomach to become the ruling power of his system&mdash;a
tyrant that can bear no one&rsquo;s presence but his own. The poor pig,
thus treated, gorges himself&mdash;sleeps&mdash;eats again&mdash;sleeps&mdash;awakens
in a fright&mdash;screams&mdash;struggles against the blue apron&mdash;screams
fainter and fainter&mdash;turns up the whites of his little eyes&mdash;and
...... dies!</p>

<p>It is probably from abhorring this picture, that I know of nothing
which is more distressing to me than to witness an indolent man
eating his own home-fed pork.</p>

<p>There is something so horridly similar between the life of the
human being and that of his victim&mdash;their notions on all subjects
are so unnaturally contracted&mdash;there is such a melancholy resemblance
between the strutting residence in the village, and the stalking
confinement of the sty&mdash;between the sound of the dinner-bell
and the rattling of the pail&mdash;between snoring in an arm-chair and
grunting in clean straw&mdash;that, when I contrast the &ldquo;pig&rsquo;s countenance&rdquo;
in the dish with that of his lord and master, who, with outstretched
elbows, sits leaning over it, I own I always feel it is so
hard the one should have killed the other&mdash;in short, there is a sort
of &ldquo;Tu quoque, <em class="smcap">Brute</em>!&rdquo; moral in the picture, which to my mind
is most painfully distressing.</p>

<p>But to return to the Schwein-general, whom, with his horn and
whip, I have left on the steep side of a barren mountain.</p>

<p>In this situation do the pigs remain every morning for four hours,
enjoying little else than air and exercise. At about nine or ten
o'clock, they begin their march homewards, and nothing can form
a greater contrast than their entry into their native town does to
their exit from it.</p>

<p>Their eager anxiety to get to the dinner-trough that awaits them
is almost ungovernable; and they no sooner reach the first houses
of the town, than a sort of &ldquo;sauve qui peut&rdquo; motion takes place:
away each then starts towards his dulce domum; and it is really
curious to stand still and watch how very quickly they canter by,
greedily grunting and snuffling as if they could smell with their
stomachs, as well as their noses, the savoury food which was awaiting
them.</p>

<p>At half-past four, the same four notes of the same horn are heard
again; the pigs once more assemble&mdash;once more tumble over the
hot stones on the mountain&mdash;once more remain there for four hours&mdash;and
in the evening once again return to their styes.</p>

<p>Such is the life of the pigs not only of Langen-Schwalbach, but
those of every village throughout a great part of Germany: every
day of their existence, summer and winter, is spent in the way I
have described. The squad consists here of about a hundred and
fifty, and for each pig the poor old Schwein-general receives forty
kreuzers (about 13<i>d.</i>) for six months&rsquo; drilling of each recruit. His
income, therefore, is about 20<i>l.</i> a year, out of which he has to pay
the board, lodging, and clothing of his two aid-de-camps; and
when one considers how unremittingly this poor fellow-creature
has to contend with the gross appetites, sulky tempers, and pig-headed
dispositions of the swinish multitude, surely not even the
most niggardly reformer would wish to curtail his emoluments.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LUTHERAN_CHAPEL" id="THE_LUTHERAN_CHAPEL">THE LUTHERAN CHAPEL.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> just come from the little Lutheran chapel, and while the
picture is fresh before my mind, I will endeavour to describe it.</p>

<p>On entering the church, the service I found had begun, and the
first thing that struck me was, that the pulpit was empty, there
being no minister of any sort or kind to be seen! The congregation
were chaunting a psalm to very much the same sort of drawling
tune which one hears in England; yet the difference in their performance
of it was very remarkable. As all were singing about as
loud as they could, the chorus was certainly too much for the
church: indeed, the sound had not only filled its walls, but, streaming
out of the doors and every aperture, it had rolled down the main
street, where I had met it long before I reached the church. Yet,
though it was certainly administered in too strong a dose, it was
impossible to help acknowledging that it proceeded from a peasantry
who had a gift or natural notion of music, quite superior to
anything one meets with in an English village, or even in a London
church. The song was simple, and the lungs from which it proceeded
were too stout; yet there was nothing to offend the ear:
in short, there were no bad faults to eradicate&mdash;no nasal whine&mdash;no
vulgar tremulous mixture of two notes&mdash;no awkward attempts
at musical finery&mdash;but in every bar there was tune and melody,
and with apparently no one to guide them, these native
musicians proceeded with their psalm in perfect harmony and concert.</p>

<p>As this singing lasted nearly twenty minutes, I had plenty of
time to look about me. The church, which with its little spire
stands on a gentle eminence above the houses of the main street, is
a small oblong building of four windows in length by two in breadth;
the glass in these recesses is composed of round, plain, unpainted
panes, about the size of a common tea-saucer. The inside of the
building is whitewashed: a gallery of unpainted wood, supported
by posts very rudely hewn, going nearly round three sides of it.
There were no pews, but rows of benches occupied about three-fourths
of the body of the church; the remaining quarter (which
was opposite to the principal entrance-door) being elevated three
steps above the rest. At the back of this little platform, leaning
against the wall, there was a pulpit containing only one reading-desk,
and above it a sounding-board, surmounted by a gilt image
of the sun&mdash;the only ornament in the church. In front of the pulpit,
between it and the congregation, I observed a small, high,
oblong table, covered with a plain white table-cloth, and on the
right and left of the pulpit, there existed an odd-looking pew, latticed
so closely that no one could see at all perfectly through it.</p>

<p>The three galleries were occupied by men dressed all alike in
the common blue cloth Sunday clothes of the country. The
benches beneath were filled with women; and as I glanced an eye
from one row to another, it was impossible to help regretting the
sad progress, or rather devastation, which fashion is making in the
national costume even of the little village of Langen-Schwalbach.
Three benches nearest to the door were filled with women all
dressed in the old genuine &ldquo;buy a broom&rdquo; costume of this country&mdash;their
odd little white caps, their open stays, and their fully-plaited
short petticoats seeming to have been cast in one model;
in short, they were clad in the native livery of their hills. Next
to these were seated four rows of women and girls, who, nibbling
at novelty, had ventured to exchange the caps of their female ancestors
for plain horn combs; over their stays some had put cotton
gowns, the coloured patterns of which seemed to be vulgarly
quarrelling among each other for precedence. Next came a row
of women in caps, frilled and bedizened.</p>

<p>The Langen-Schwalbach ladies, who occupied the other two
benches, and who were seated behind a row of boys immediately
before the white table, had absolutely ventured to put on their
heads bonnets with artificial flowers, &amp;c.; in short, they had rigged
themselves out as fine ladies&mdash;wore gloves&mdash;tight shoes&mdash;blew
their noses with handkerchiefs, evidently conceiving themselves
(as indeed they were) fit for London, Paris, or any other equally
brilliant speck in the fashionable world.</p>

<p>As soon as the singing was over, a dead pause ensued, which
lasted for many seconds, and I was wondering from what part of
the chapel the next human voice would proceed, when very indistinctly
I saw something moving in one of the latticed pews&mdash;slowly
it glided towards the stair of the pulpit, until mounting above the
lattice-work, the uncertain vision changed into a remarkably tall,
portly gentleman in black, who was now clearly seen leisurely ascending
towards the pulpit, on the right of which hung a large
black slate, on which were written, in white chalk, the numbers
414 and 309.</p>

<p>As soon as the clergyman had very gravely glanced his eyes
round the whole church, as if to recognise his congregation, he
slowly, syllable by syllable, began an extempore address; and the
first words had scarcely left his lips when I could not help feeling
that I was listening to the deepest&mdash;the gravest&mdash;and the most
impressive voice I ever remember to have heard. But the whole
appearance and manner of the man quite surprised me, so completely
superior was he to anything I had at all expected to have
met with. Indeed, for many minutes, I had given up all hopes of
hearing any clergyman at all; certainly not one whose every look,
word, and action, seemed to proceed from the deepest thought
and reflection. Dressed in a suit of common black clothes, he
had apparently nothing to distinguish his holy vocation but the
two white bands which are worn by our clergymen, and which
appeared to be the only neckcloth he wore. In a loud calm tone
of voice, which, perfectly devoid of energy, seemed to be directed
not to the hearts but to the understandings of his hearers, he advocated
a cause in which he evidently felt that he was triumphant;
and the stillness of his attitude, the deep calmness of his voice, and
the icy cold deliberation with which he spoke, proved that he was
master not only of his subject, but of himself.</p>

<p>Every word he said was apparently visible in his eyes, as if
reflected there from his brain. He stood neither entreating, commanding,
nor forbidding; but like a man mathematically demonstrating
a problem, he was, step by step, steadily laying before the
judgment of his hearers truths and arguments which he well knew
it was out of their power to deny. When he had reached his
climax he suddenly changed his voice, and, apparently conscious
of the victory he had gained, in a sort of half-deep tone he began
to ask a series of questions, each of which was followed by a long
pause; and in these solemn moments, when his argument had
gained its victory&mdash;when the fabric he had been raising was
crowned with success&mdash;there was a benignity in the triumph of
his unexpected smile, which I could not but admire, as the momentary
joy seemed to arise more for the sake of others than for
his own.</p>

<p>Occasionally during the discourse he raised a hand towards
heaven&mdash;occasionally he firmly placed it on the bosom of his own
dark cloth waistcoat, and then, slowly extending it towards his congregation,
it fell again lifeless to his side; yet these actions, trifling
as they were, became very remarkable when contrasted with the
motionless attention of the congregation.</p>

<p>At times, an old woman, with the knuckle of her shrivelled finger,
would wipe an eye, as if the subject were stealing from her head
to her heart; but no show of feeling was apparent in the minister
who was addressing her; with apostolic dignity, he coldly proceeded
with his argument, and amidst the storm, the tempest of her
feelings&mdash;he calmly walked upon the wave! Never did I before
see a human being listened to with such statue-like attention.</p>

<p>As soon as the discourse was concluded, the psalm was given
out&mdash;a general rustling of leaves was heard, and in a few moments
the whole congregation began, with open barn-door mouths, to
sing. During this operation the preacher did not sit up in his
pulpit to be stared at, but his presence not being required there,
he descended into his pew, where I could just faintly trace him
through the lattice-work. Whether he sang or not I do not know;
he was probably resting after his fatigue.</p>

<p>The singing lasted a long time&mdash;the tune and performance were
much what I have already described, and when the psalm came
to an end, the same dead pause ensued. It continued rather longer
than before; at last the front door of the latticed pew opened,
and out walked the tall self-same clergyman in black. As he slowly
advanced along the little platform, there was a general rustling of
the congregation shutting their books, until he stood directly in
front of the little high table covered with the white cloth.</p>

<p>With the same pale, placid dignity of manner, he pronounced
a short blessing on the congregation, who all leant forwards, as if
anxious to receive it; and then dropping his two arms, which,
during this short ceremony, had been extended before him, he
turned round, and as he slowly walked towards his latticed cell,
the people all shuffled out the other way&mdash;until, in a few seconds,
the small Lutheran chapel of Langen-Schwalbach was empty.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_NEW_SCHOOL" id="THE_NEW_SCHOOL">THE NEW SCHOOL.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> morning, during breakfast, I observed several little children
passing my window in their best clothes. The boys wore a sort
of green sash of oak-leaves, which, coming over the right shoulder,
crossed the back and breast, and then winding once round the waist,
hung in two ends on the left side. The girls, dressed in common
white frocks, had roses in their hair, and held green garlands in
their hands. On inquiring the reason of the children being dressed
in this way, I found out, with some difficulty, that there was to be
a great festival and procession, to celebrate the taking possession of
a new school, which, built by the town, was only just completed.
Accordingly, following some of the little ones down the main street,
I passed this village seminary, whose first birth-day was thus about
to be commemorated. It was a substantial building, consisting of
a centre, with two square projecting wings, and it was quite large
enough to be taken by any stranger for the Hotel-de-Ville of Langen-Schwalbach.
Wreaths of oak-leaves were suspended in front,
and long verdant garlands from the same trees hung in festoons
from one wing to the other. It was impossible to contrast the size
of this building with the small houses in its neighbourhood, without
feeling how creditable it was to the inhabitants of so small a town thus
to show that a portion of the wealth they had mildly sucked from
the stranger&rsquo;s purse was so sensibly and patriotically expended.
The scale of the building seemed to indicate that the peasants of
Langen-Schwalbach were liberal enough to desire that their children
should grow up more enlightened than themselves; and as I passed it,
I could not help recollecting, with feelings of deep regret, that although
in England there is no art or trade that has not made great
improvement and progress, the cramped pater-noster system of our
public schools, as well as of our universities, have too long remained
almost the only pools stagnant in the country, a fact which
can scarcely be reconciled with the rapid progress which our lower
orders have lately made in useful knowledge.</p>

<p>After passing this new seminary, I continued descending the main
street about one hundred yards, which brought me to a small crowd
of people, standing before the old school, into the door of which,
creeping under the arms of the people, child after child hurried
and disappeared, like a bee going into its hive.</p>

<p>The old school of Langen-Schwalbach is one of the most ancient
buildings in the town. Its elevation is fantastic, bordering on
the grotesque. The gable seems to be nodding forwards, the hump-backed
roof to be sinking in. The wooden frame-work of the house,
composed of beams purposely bent into almost every form, has besides
been very curiously hewn and carved, and on the front wall,
placed most irregularly there are several inscriptions, such as &ldquo;<i>ora
et labora</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;1552,&rdquo; and then again a sentence in German, dated
1643, describing that in that year the house was repaired. There
is also a grotesque image on the wall, of a child hugging a cornucopia,
&amp;c., &amp;c. Nevertheless, though all the parts of this ancient
edifice are very rude, there is &ldquo;a method in the madness&rdquo; with
which they are arranged, that, somehow or other, makes the <i>tout
ensemble</i> very pleasing; and whether it be admitted to be good-looking
or not, its venerable appearance almost any one would be
disposed to respect.</p>

<p>I observed that no one entered this door but the children. However,
as in this simple, civil country great privileges are granted
to strangers (for here, like kings, they can hardly do wrong), I ascended
an old rattle-trap staircase, until coming to a landing-place,
I found one large room on my left crammed full of little boys, and
one on my right overflowing with little girls, these two chambers
composing the whole of the building.</p>

<p>On the landing-place I met the three masters, all dressed very
respectably in black cloth clothes. The senior was about forty
years of age, the two others quiet, nice-looking men of about
twenty-six, one of whom, to my very great astonishment, addressed
me in English. He spoke the language very well, said he could
read it with ease, but added that he had great difficulty in understanding
it, unless when spoken very slowly; in short, as an enjoyment
through the long-winded evenings of winter, he had actually
taught himself our hissing, crabbed language, which he had
only heard spoken by a solitary Englishman whose acquaintance he
had formed last year.</p>

<p>He seemed not only to be well acquainted with our English authors,
but talked very sensibly about the institutions and establishments
of our country; in short, he evidently knew a great deal more
of England than England knows of Langen-Schwalbach, of the
duchy of Nassau, or of many much vaster portions of the globe.
He informed me that the school was composed of 150 boys, and
about the same number of girls;&mdash;that of these 300 children 180
were Protestants, 90 Catholics; and that since the year 1827 the
town having agreed to admit to the blessings and advantages of
education the children of the Jews, there were twenty little boys of
that persuasion, and one girl. Having witnessed the prejudice, and
indeed hatred, which Christians and Jews in many countries mutually
entertain towards each other, I was not little surprised at the
statement thus related to me.</p>

<p>After listening for some time to the tutor, he offered to show
me the children, and accordingly with some difficulty we worked
our way into the boys room. It was a pretty sight to witness such an
assemblage of little fellows with clean shining faces, and their native
oak-leaves gave a freshness to the scene which was very delightful.</p>

<p>Among these white-haired laddies, most of whom were from
four to eight years of age, it was quite unnecessary to inquire
which were the Jew boys, for there each stood, as distinctly marked
as their race is all over the face of the globe; yet I must acknowledge
they were by far the handsomest children in the room, looking
much more like Spaniards than Germans. The chamberfull
of little girls would have pleased anybody, so nicely were they dressed,
and apparently so well-behaved. Several were exceedingly
pretty children, and the garlands they held in their hands, the
wreaths of roses which bloomed on their heads, and the smiles that
beamed in their faces, formed as pretty a mixture of the animal
and vegetable creation as could well be imagined.</p>

<p>In one corner stood the only Jewish girl in the room, and Rebecca
herself could not have had a handsomer nose, a pair of
brighter eyes, or a more marked expression of countenance.
She was more richly dressed than the other village girls&mdash;wore
a necklace, and I observed a thick gold or brass ring on
the forefinger of her left hand. We went several times from one
room full of children to the other, and it was really pleasing to see
in a state of such thoughtless innocence those who were to become
the future possessors of the houses and property of Langen-Schwalbach.
All of a sudden, a signal was given to the children to
descend, and it became then quite as much as the three masters
could do to make them go out of the room hand-in-hand. Down
scrambled first the boys, and then more quietly followed the little
girls, though not without one or two screams proceeding from those
who, in their hurry, had dropped their garlands. One of these
green hoops I picked up, and seeing a little girl crying her heart
out, I gave it to her, and no balm of Gilead ever worked so sudden
a cure; for away she ran, and joined her comrades, laughing.</p>

<p>As soon as the children had all left the two rooms, the three
masters descended, and we followed them into the street, where
the civil authorities of the town, and almost all the parents of the
little ones, had assembled. With great difficulty the children were
all collected together in a group, in the open air exactly in front of
the school; and when this arrangement was effected, the mayor,
two Catholic ministers, two Protestant clergymen, and the three
masters, stood exactly in front of the children, facing also the house
from which they had proceeded. For some time, the masters and
the four Christian ministers stood smiling and talking to each
other; however, at last the mayor made a bow, everybody took off
their hats, the ministers&rsquo; countenances stiffened, and for a few seconds
a dead silence ensued. At last the mayor with due ceremony
took off his hat, when the youngest of the Lutheran ministers,
advancing one step in front, commenced a long address to the
children.</p>

<p>What he said I was not near enough to hear; but I saw constantly
beaming in his countenance that sort of benevolent smile,
which would be natural almost to any one, in addressing so very
youthful a congregation. Occasionally he pointed with his hand to
heaven, and then, continuing his subject, smiled as if to cheer them
on the way; but the little toads, instead of attending to him, were
all apparently eager to get to their fine new school, and with roses
on their heads, and garlands in their hands, they seemed as if they
did not feel that they stood in need of a routing dose of good advice;
in short, not one of them appeared to pay the slightest attention
to a discourse which could not but have been very interesting
to the parents. However, in one respect I must own I was slightly
disappointed; the burden of the discourse must have been on the
duties and future prospects of the children, and on the honours and
advantages of the new school; for I particularly remarked that not
once did the clergyman point or address himself to the old building&mdash;not
a single eye but my own was ever turned towards it, and
none but myself seemed to feel for it any regret that it was about
to lose a village importance which for so many years it had enjoyed.
It was sentenced to be deserted, and walls which had long
been enlivened by the cheerful sound of youthful voices, were in
their old age suddenly to be bereft of all!</p>

<p>I could not help feeling for the old institution, and when the discourse
was ended&mdash;when hats had returned to people&rsquo;s heads, and
when the procession of children, followed by the ministers, had
already begun to move, I could not for some time take my eyes off
the old fabric. The date of 1552, and the rude-looking image of the
boy, particularly attracted my attention; however, the old hive was
deserted,&mdash;the bees had swarmed,&mdash;had already hovered in the
air, and to their new abode they had all flown away. Jostled from
my position by people who were following the procession, I proceeded
onwards with the crowd, but not without mumbling to
myself&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Let others hail the rising sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I bow to him whose course is run.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>As soon as the children reached their fine new abode, a band,
which had been awaiting their arrival, struck up; and in the open
air they instantly sung a hymn. The doors were then thrown open,
and in high glee the little creatures scrambled up the staircase, and
the mayor, clergymen, and schoolmasters having followed, a great
rush was made by parents and spectators. I managed to gain a
good place, but in a very few moments the room was filled, and so
jammed up with people, that they could scarcely raise their hands
to wipe the perspiration which soon began to appear very copiously
on all faces. It became dreadfully hot, and besides suffering from
this cause, I felt by no means happy at a calculation which very
unwelcomely kept forcing itself into my mind,&mdash;namely, that the
immense weight of human flesh which was for the first time trying
new beams, might produce a consummation by no means &ldquo;devoutly
to be wished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as order was established, and silence obtained, the Catholic
minister addressed the children; and when he had finished,
the tall Lutheran clergyman, whose description I have already
given to the reader, followed in his deepest tone, and with his gravest
demeanour; but it was all lost upon the children: indeed it was
so hot, and we were so little at our ease, that all were very glad,
indeed, to hear him conclude by the word &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The children now sang another hymn, which, in a cooler climate,
would have been quite beautiful; the mayor made a bow&mdash;the
thing was at an end, and I believe every one was as much delighted
as myself to get once again into pure fresh air.</p>

<p>As I had been told by the teacher that the children would dance
and eat in the evening, at four o'clock, I went again to the school at
that hour, expecting that there would be what in England would be
called &ldquo;a ball and supper;&rdquo; however, the supper had come first,
and the remains of it were on two long tables. The feast which
the little ones had been enjoying had consisted of a slice of white
bread and a glass of Rhenish wine for each; and, as soon as I entered
the room, two policemen bowed and begged me to be seated.
They and their friends were evidently regaling themselves with the
wine which had been furnished for the children; however, the little
creatures did not seem to want it, and I was very glad to see it inflaming
the eyes of the old party, and flushing their cheeks, instead
of having a similar effect on the young ones.</p>

<p>It had been settled that the children were to dance; but they
were much too young to care for such an amusement. The little
boys had got together at one end of the room, and the girls were
sitting laughing at the other, both groups being as happily independent
as it was possible to be. Sometimes the boys amused
themselves with a singing game&mdash;one chaunting a line, and all the
rest bursting in with the chorus, which, though it contained nearly
as much laughter as music, showed that the youngsters were well
enough conversant with both. The girls had also their song. As
I left the room several of the children were singing on the stairs&mdash;all
were as happy as I had desired to see them; and yet I firmly
believe that the whole festival I have described,&mdash;oak-leaves, roses,
garlands, festoons, bread, wine, &amp;c., altogether,&mdash;could not have
cost the town of Langen-Schwalbach ten shillings! Nevertheless,
in its history, the opening of a public establishment so useful to future
generations, and so creditable to the present one, was an event
of no inconsiderable importance.</p>

<div>
<h2><a name="THE_OLD_PROTESTANT_CHURCH" id="THE_OLD_PROTESTANT_CHURCH">THE OLD PROTESTANT CHURCH.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> old Protestant Church, at the lower extremity of Langen-Schwalbach,
has not been preached in for about three years; and
being locked up, I had to call for admission at a house in the centre
of the town. The man was not at home, but his wife (very busily
employed in dressing, against its will, a squalling infant) pointed to
the key, which I gravely took from a nail over her head. This venerable
building stands, or rather totters, on a small eminence
close to the road&mdash;long rents in its walls, and the ruinous, decayed
state of the mortar, sufficiently denoting its great antiquity. The
roof and spire are still covered with slates, which seem fluttering as
if about to take their departure. The churchyard continues in the
valley to be the only Christian receptacle for the dead; and within
its narrow limits, Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists end their
worldly differences by soundly sleeping together, side by side. Here
and there a tree is seen standing at the head of a Protestant&rsquo;s
grave; but though the twig was exclusively planted there, yet its
branches, like knowledge, have gradually extended themselves, until
they now wave and droop alike over those who, thus joined in
death, had, nevertheless, lived in paltry opposition to each other.
The rank grass also grows with equal luxuriance over all, as if the
turf, like the trees, was anxious to level all human animosities, and
to become the winding-sheet or covering of Christian fraternities
which ought never to have disputed.</p>

<p>In various parts of the cemetery I observed several worn-out,
wooden, triangular monuments on the totter; while others were
lying prostrate on the grass&mdash;the &ldquo;hic jacet&rdquo; being exactly as applicable
to each of themselves as to that departed being, whose life
and death they had vainly presumed to commemorate. Although
the inscriptions recorded by these frail historians were scarcely
legible, yet roses and annual flowers, blooming on the grave,
plainly showed that there was still in existence some friendly hand,
some foot, some heart, that moved with kindly recollection towards
the dead. Upon several recent graves of children there were
placed, instead of tombstones, the wreaths of artificial flowers,
which, during their funeral, had either rested upon the coffin, or
had been carried in the hands of parents and friends. The sun
and rain&mdash;the wind and storm&mdash;had blanched the artificial bloom
from the red roses, and, of course, had sullied the purity of the
white ones; yet this worthless finery, lying upon the newly-moved
earth, had probably witnessed unaffected feelings, to which the
cold, white marble monument is often a stranger. The little heap
of perishable wreaths, so lightly piled one upon the other, was the
act, the tribute, the effusion of the moment; it was all the mother
had had to record her feelings; it was what she had left behind her,
as she tore herself away; and though it could not, I own, be compared
to a monument sculptured by an artist, yet, resting above the
coffin, it had one intrinsic value, at least&mdash;it had been left there by
a friend!</p>

<p>At one corner of the churchyard, there was a grave which was
only just completed. The living labourer had retired from it; the
dead tenant had not yet arrived; but the moment I looked into it, I
could not help feeling how any one of our body-snatchers would have
rubbed his rough hands, and what rude raptures he would have
enjoyed, at observing that the lid of the coffin would be deposited
scarcely a foot and a half below the sod. However, in the little
duchy of Nassau, human corpses have not yet become coin current
in the realm; and whatever may be a man&rsquo;s troubles during his life,
at Langen-Schwalbach he may truly say he will, at least, find rest
in the grave.</p>

<p>I know it is very wrong&mdash;I know that one is always blamed for
bringing before the mind of wealthy people any truth which is at all
disagreeable to them; yet on the brink of this grave I could not help
feeling how very much one ought to detest the polite Paris and
London fashion of smartening up us old people with the teeth and
hair of the dead? It always seems to me so unfair, for us who
have <i>had</i> our day&mdash;who have ourselves <i>been</i> young&mdash;to attempt,
when we grow old, to deprive the rising generation of the advantage
of that contrast which so naturally enhances their beauties. The
spring of life, to be justly appreciated and admired, requires to be
compared with the snow and storms of winter, and if by chicanery
you hide the latter, the sunshine of the former loses a great portion
of its beauty. In naked, savage life, there exists no picture on which
I have so repeatedly gazed with calm pleasure, as that of the
daughter supporting the trembling, dilapidated fabric of the being
to whom she owes her birth; indeed, it is as impossible for man
to withhold the respect and pity which is due to age whenever it be
seen labouring under its real infirmities, as it is for him to contain
his admiration of the natural loveliness of youth. The parent and
child, thus contrasted, render to each other services of which both
appear to be insensible; for the mother does not seem aware how
the shattered outlines of her faded frame heighten the robust, blooming
beauties of her child, who, in her turn, seems equally unconscious
how beautifully and eloquently her figure explains and pleads
for the helpless decrepitude of age! In the Babel confusion of our
fashionable world, this beautifully arranged contrast of nature, the
effect of which no one who has ever seen it can forget, does not
exist. Before the hair has grown really grey&mdash;before time has imparted
to it even its autumnal tint, it is artfully replaced by dark
flowing locks, obtained by every revolting contrivance. The grave
itself is attacked&mdash;our living dowagers of the present day do not
hesitate to borrow their youthful ornaments even from the dead&mdash;and
to such a horrid extreme has fashion encouraged this unnatural
propensity, that even the carcase of the soldier, who has fallen in a
foreign land, and who,</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>has not been respected!</p>

<p>One would think that the ribands and honours on his breast,
flapping in the wind, would have scared even the vulture from such
prey; but no! the orders which the London dentist has received
must, he pleads, be punctually executed; and it is a revolting fact,
but too well known to &ldquo;the trade,&rdquo; that many, and many, and many
a set of teeth which bit the dust of Waterloo, by an untimely resurrection,
appeared again on earth, smiling lasciviously at Almack&rsquo;s
ball! So much for what is termed <em class="smcap">fashion</em>.</p>

<p>After rambling about the churchyard for some minutes, occasionally
spelling at an inscription, and sometimes looking at (not
picking) a sepulchral flower, I walked to the church-door, and turning
round its old-fashioned key, which ever since I had received it
had been dangling in my hand, the lock started back, and then, as
if I had said &ldquo;Open Sesame!&rdquo; the door opened.</p>

<p>On looking before me, my first impression was that my head
was swimming! for the old gallery, hanging like the gardens of
Babylon, seemed to be writhing; the four-and-twenty pews were
leaning sideways; the aisle, or approach to the altar, covered with
heaps of rubbish, was an undulating line, and an immense sepulchral
flag-stone had actually been lifted up at one side, as if the
corpse, finding the church deserted, had resolutely burst from his
grave, and had wrenched himself once again into daylight. The
pulpit was out of its perpendicular; some pictures, loosely hanging
against the wall, had turned away their faces; and a couple of
planks were resting diagonally against the altar, as if they had
fallen from the roof. I really rubbed my eyes, fancying that they
were disordered; however, the confusion I witnessed was real,
and as nearly as possible as I have described it. Still, however,
there was no dampness in the church, and it was, I thought, a remarkable
proof of the dryness of the light mountain air of Langen-Schwalbach,
that the sepulchral wreaths of artificial flowers which
were hanging around on the walls were as starched and stiff as on
the day they were placed there.</p>

<p>A piece of dingy black cloth, with narrow white fringe, was the
only ornament to the pulpit, from which both book and minister had
so long departed. The thing was altogether on the totter; yet
when I reflected what little harm it had done in the world, and how
much good, I could not help acknowledging that respect was justly
due to its old age, and that, even by the stranger, it ought to be regarded
with sentiments of veneration. In gazing at monuments of
antiquity, one of the most natural pleasures which the mind enjoys
is by them fancifully transported to the scenes which they so clearly
commemorate. The Roman amphitheatre becomes filled with
gladiators and spectators;&mdash;the streets of Pompeii are seen again
thronged with people;&mdash;the Grecian temple is ornamented with
the votive offerings of heroes and of senators;&mdash;even the putrid
marsh of Marathon teems with noble recollections;&mdash;while at home,
on the battlements of our old English castles, we easily figure to
ourselves barons proud of their deeds, and vassals in armour faithfully
devoted to their service: in short, while beholding such
scenes, the heart glows, until, by its feverish heat, feelings are produced
to which no one can be completely insensible: however,
when we awaken from this delightful dream, it is difficult, indeed
impossible, to drive away the painful moral which, sooner or later
in the day, proves to us much too clearly, that these ruins have outlived,
and in fact commemorate, the errors, the passions, and the
prejudices, which caused them to be built.</p>

<p>But after looking up at the plain, unassuming pulpit of an old
Lutheran church, one feels, long after one has left it, that all that
has proceeded from its simple desk has been to promulgate peace,
good-will, and happiness among mankind&mdash;and though, in its old
age, it be now deserted, yet no one can deny that the seeds which
in various directions it has scattered before the wind are not only
vigorously flourishing in the little valley in which it stands, but must
continue there and elsewhere to produce effects, which time itself
can scarcely annihilate.</p>

<p>Turning towards the altar, I was looking at pictures of the twelve
apostles, who, like sentinels at their posts, were in various attitudes
surrounding it, when <i>à propos</i> to nothing, the great clock in the
belfry struck four, and so little did I expect to hear any noise at all,
that I could not help starting at being thus suddenly reminded, that
the watch was still ticking in the fob of the dead soldier&mdash;in short,
that that clock was still faithfully pointing out the progress of time,
though the church to which it belonged had already, practically
speaking, terminated its existence! Never did I before listen to
four vibrations of an old church clock with more reverential attention:
however, at each stroke involuntarily looking upwards, I did
not altogether enjoy the sight of some loose rafters which were
hanging over my head. I therefore very quietly moved onwards,
yet, passing a small door, I could not resist clambering up an old
well staircase which led to the belfry; not, however, until I had calculated
that, as the building could bear the bells, my weight was
not likely to turn the scale. I did not, however, feel disposed to
reach the bells, but managed, through a rent in the wall, to look
down on the roof, and such a scene of devastation it would be difficult
to describe. The half-mouldered slates had not only been
ripped away by the wind in every direction, but the remainder
appeared as if they were just ready to follow in the flight.
The roof was bending in, and altogether it looked so completely
on the totter, that the slightest additional weight would have
brought every thing to the ground. After descending, I went once
more round the church, opened some of the old latticed pews&mdash;peeped
into the marble font, which was half-filled with decayed
mortar&mdash;took up a bird&rsquo;s nest that had fallen into the chancel from
the roof, and strolling towards the altar, I found there a small
board covered with white pasteboard, and ornamented with a garland
of roses. On this simple tablet were inscribed, in black
letters, the names of the little band of Langen-Schwalbachians
who had been present in the great campaign of 1815; and in case
the reader should like to know not only who were the heroes of so
remote a valley, but also what sort of names they possessed, I offer
him a copy of the muster-roll of those thus distinguished for having
served their native country, which the German language emphatically
calls &ldquo;Vaterland.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<p>Having carefully locked up the old church with all the relics it
contained, descending the steps of the eminence on which it stood,
I once more found myself in the street among fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>The new Protestant church, which is very shortly to be built,
and to which the bells of this old one, if possible, are to be removed,
will be in the centre of the town, but this site, though more convenient,
will not, I think, be so picturesque as that of the old building,
which, with the Catholic Church at the other extremity of the
town, seem to be the alpha and omega&mdash;the beginning and the end
of Langen-Schwalbach. From the surrounding hills, as the eye
glances from the one of these old buildings to the other, they appear
to be the good Genii of the town&mdash;two guardian angels to
watch over the welfare of its people here and hereafter.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_JEWISH_SYNAGOGUE" id="THE_JEWISH_SYNAGOGUE">THE JEWISH SYNAGOGUE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> low part of Langen-Schwalbach, where the Jews live, is the
most ancient portion of the town, the houses they inhabit being just
above and below the great original brunnen or fountain, which, as
I have stated, was celebrated for its medicinal properties even in
the time of the Romans. This immense spring, which rises within
a foot and a half of the surface of the ground (being then carried
away by a subterranean drain), is two or three times as large as
the Stahl brunnen, the Wein brunnen, or the fashionable Pauline.
It contains very little iron, being principally sulphureous. From
the violence with which it rises from the rock, the water is apparently
constantly boiling, and such a suffocating gas arises from
it, that, as at the Grotto del Cane, at Naples, one single inhalation
would be nearly sufficient to deprive a person of his senses. Besides
being strongly impregnated with this gas, it has also such an unearthly
taste, that one almost fancies it must flow direct from the
cellar of his Satanic majesty. Still, however, the Jews constantly
drink, cook, and even wash with this water; however, being below
the surface, it is necessary for them to stoop into the suffocating
vapour whenever they fill their pitchers; and as one sees Jewess
after Jewess dipping her dark greasy head into this infernal
caldron, holding her breath, and then suddenly raising her head,
with a momentary paleness and an aspiration which sufficiently explain
her sensations, one feels anything but sympathy for a being
who can voluntarily flutter in such a fetid climate.</p>

<p>With sentiments, I fear, not very liberal, I stood for many minutes
looking at those who came to fill their pitchers; at last, rather
a better feeling shooting across me, I resolved once more to make
a trial of water on which so many of my fellow-creatures seemed
to subsist, and I accordingly dipped my hand into a large washing-tub
which an old Jewess had half suffocated herself in filling with
her pitcher. The woman offered me no sign or word of disrespect;
but I saw her cast a withering look at the water, as if a cup of poison
had been poured into it: she continued, however, very quietly
to fill her other tubs; but after I had walked away, turning suddenly
round for a moment, I saw her upset the tub from which I
had drunk, her lips muttering at the same time some short observation
to a sister Jewess standing beside her.</p>

<p>I could not, however, help acknowledging that her prejudice
was not more illiberal, and certainly far more excusable, than my
own; and as I had determined to attend that evening the Jewish
synagogue, in the meanwhile I did what I could to bring my mind
to a proper state of feeling towards a people whose form of worship
I was desirous seriously to witness.</p>

<p>Never had I before chanced to enter a synagogue; yet, when I
had reflected on the singular history of the Jews, I had often concluded
that there must be some strange, unaccountable attraction,
something inexplicably mysterious in their forms of worship, which
could have induced them to brave the persecutions that in all ages,
and in so many countries, had traced out their history in letters of
blood.</p>

<p>Full of curiosity, I had therefore inquired at what hour on Friday
their church would assemble, and being told that they would meet
&ldquo;as soon as the stars were visible,&rdquo; I walked towards the synagogue,
a few minutes after sunset, and in every Jewish house I observed,
as I passed it, seven candles burning in a circle. The house
of worship was a small oblong hovel, not unlike a barn. The door
was open, but no human being appeared within, excepting a man
over whose shoulders there was thrown a piece of common brown
sackcloth. This personage, who turned out to be the priest, stood
before a sort of altar; and, just as careless of it as of us, he stood
bowing to it incessantly. There being not much to see in these
vibrations, I walked away, and returning in about five minutes, I
found the congregation had suddenly assembled, and the service
begun.</p>

<p>In the course of my life, like most people, I have chanced to witness
a great variety of forms of worship, several of which it would
not be very easy to describe. For instance, it would be difficult, or
rather impossible, to delineate, by words, high mass, as performed
in the great church of St. Peter, at Rome. One might, indeed,
fully describe any part of it, but the silence of one moment, the
burst of music at another, the immensity of the building, and the
assembled congregation, produce altogether sensations on the eye
and ear which the goose-quill has not power to impart. Again, to
the simple homage which a Peruvian Indian pays to the sun no man
could do justice; one might describe his attitude as he prostrates
himself before what he conceives to be the burning ruler of the universe,
but the fleeting expressions of his supplicating countenance,
as it trembles&mdash;hopes&mdash;flushes&mdash;and then, with eyes dazzled to
dimness, trembles again,&mdash;may be witnessed, but cannot be described.
One of the wildest forms of worship I ever beheld was,
perhaps, the dance of the Dervishes, at Athens; for there is a sort
of enthusiasm in the convulsions into which these twelve men
throw themselves, which has a most indescribable effect on those
who witness it: it is madness,&mdash;yet it is a tempest of the mind
within the range of which no man&rsquo;s senses can live unruffled;&mdash;the
strongest judgment bends before the gale, and insensibly are
the feelings led astray by conduct, actions, words, grimaces, and
contortions, which, taken altogether, are indescribable.</p>

<p>But although these and many other forms of worship may be
original pictures which cannot be copied, yet I think a child of ten
years of age, if he could only hold a pen, might give a reader as
good a notion of the Langen-Schwalbach synagogue, as if he had
been there himself a thousand times; for all the poor child would
have to do would be to beg him imagine a small dirty barn, swarming
with fleas, filled with dirty-looking men in dirty dresses, with
old hats on their heads, spitting&mdash;hallooing&mdash;reading&mdash;bowing&mdash;hallooing
louder than ever&mdash;scratching themselves as they leave
the synagogue,&mdash;and then calmly walking home to their seven
candles!</p>

<p>To any serious, reflecting mind, all religions, to a certain point,
are worthy of respect. It is true, all cannot be right, yet the errors
are those which fellow-creatures need not dispute among each
other; he who has the happiness to go right has no just cause to
be offended with those who unfortunately have mistaken their
course; and however men&rsquo;s political opinions may radiate from
each other, yet their zeal for religion is at least one tie which ought
to connect them together. However, the Jews of Langen-Schwalbach,
so far as a spectator can judge by their behaviour, do not
even pretend to be zealous in their cause. There is no pretence
of feeling, not attempt either at humbug or effect. They perform
their service as if, having made a regular bargain to receive certain
blessings for hallooing a certain time, they conceived that all they
had to do was scrupulously to perform their part of the contract,
that there was no occasion to exceed their agreement, or give
more than was absolutely required by the bond.</p>

<p>As I stood just within the door of the synagogue, listening to
their rude, uncouth, noisy worship, almost every eye was turned
upon me, and the expression of many of the countenances was so
ill-favoured, that I very soon left them, though I had even then a
long way to walk before I ceased to hear the strange wild hullabulloo
they were making.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_HARVEST" id="THE_HARVEST">THE HARVEST.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">All</span> this day I have been strolling about the fields, watching the
getting in of the harvest. The crops of oats, rye, and wheat
(principally bearded) are much heavier than any one would expect
from such light and apparently poor land; but the heavy dews
which characterize the summer climate of this high country impart
a nourishment which, in richer lands, often lies dormant from
drought. In Nassau, the corn is cut principally by women, who
use a sickle so very small and light, that it seems but little labour
to wield it. They begin early in the morning, and with short intervals
of rest continue till eleven o'clock, when the various village
bells suddenly strike up a merry peal, which is a signal to the
labourers to come home to their dinners. It is a very interesting
scene to observe, over the undulating surface of the whole country,
groups of peasants, brothers, sisters, parents, &amp;c., all bending to
their sickles&mdash;to see children playing round infants lying fast asleep
on blue smock-frocks placed under the shade of the corn sheaves.
It is pleasing to remark the rapid progress which the several parties
are making; how each little family, attacking its own patch or property,
works its way into the standing corn, leaving the crop
prostrate behind them; and then, in the middle of this simple,
rural, busy scene, it is delightful indeed to hear from the belfry of
their much-revered churches a peal of cheerful notes, which peacefully
sound &ldquo;lullaby&rdquo; to them all. In a very few seconds the
square fields and little oblong plots are deserted, and then the
various roads and paths of the country suddenly burst in lines upon
the attention, each being delineated by a string of peasants, who
are straggling one behind the other, until paths in all directions are
seen converging towards the parental village churches, which seem
to be attracting them all.</p>

<p>As soon as each field of corn is cut, it is bound into sheaves,
about the size they are in England: seven of these are then made
to lean towards each other, and upon them all is placed a large
sheaf reversed, the ears of which hanging downwards form a sort
of thatch, which keeps this little stack dry until its owner has time
to carry it to his home. It generally remains many days in this
state, and after the harvest has been all cut, the country covered
with these stacks resembles a vast encampment.</p>

<p>The carts and waggons used for carrying the corn are exceedingly
well adapted to the country. Their particular characteristic is
excessive lightness, and, indeed, were they heavy, it would be quite
impossible for any cattle to draw them up and down the hills.
Occasionally they are drawn by horses&mdash;often by small active
oxen; but cows more generally perform this duty, and with quite
as much patience as their mistresses, at the same moment, are
labouring before them at the sickle. The yoke, or beam, by which
these cows are connected, is placed immediately behind their
horns; a little leathern pillow is then laid upon their brow, over
which passes a strap that firmly lashes their heads to the beam,
and it is, therefore, against such soft cushions that the animals
push to advance: and thus linked together for life, by this sort of
Siamese band, it is curious to observe them eating together, then
by agreement raising their heads to swallow, then again standing
motionless chewing the cud, which is seen passing and repassing
from the stomach to the mouth.</p>

<p>At first, when, standing near them, I smelt from their breath the
sweet fresh milk, it seemed hard that they should thus be, as it
were, domestic candles, lighted at both ends: however, verily do I
believe that all animals prefer exercise, or even hard work, to any
sort of confinement, and if so, they are certainly happier than our
stall-fed cows, many of which, in certain parts of Britain, may be
seen with their heads fixed economically for months between two
vertical beams of wood. The Nassau cows certainly do not seem
to suffer while working in their light carts; as soon as their mistress
advances, they follow her, and if she turns and whips them, then
they seem to hurry after her more eagerly than ever.</p>

<p>It is true, hard labour has the effect of impoverishing their milk,
and the calf at home is consequently (so far as it is concerned) a
loser by the bargain: however, there is no child in the peasant&rsquo;s
family who has not had cause to make the same complaint; and,
therefore, so long as the labourer&rsquo;s wife carries her infant to the
harvest, the milch cow may very fairly be required to draw to the
hovel what has been cut by her hands.</p>

<p>Nothing can be better adapted to the features of the country,
nothing can better accord with the feeble resources of its inhabitants,
than the equipment of these economical waggons and carts:
the cows and oxen can ascend any of the hills, or descend into any
of the valleys; they can, without slipping, go sideways along the
face of the hills, and in crossing the green, swampy, grassy-ravines,
I particularly remarked the advantage of the light waggon drawn
by animals with cloven feet; for had one of our heavy teams attempted
the passage, like a set of flies walking across a plate of
treacle, they would soon have become unable to extricate even
themselves. But in making the comparison between the horse and
the cow (as far as regards Nassau husbandry), I may further observe,
that the former has a very expensive appetite, and wears very
expensive shoes; as soon as he becomes lame he is useless, and as
soon as he is dead he is carrion. Now a placid, patient Langen-Schwalbach
cow, in the bloom of her youth, costs only two or three
pounds; she requires neither corn nor shoeing: the leaves of the
forest, drawn by herself to the village, form her bed, which in due
time she carries out to the field as manure: there is nothing a light
cart can carry which she is not ready to fetch, and from her work
she cheerfully returns to her home to give milk, cream, butter and
cheese to the establishment: at her death she is still worth eleven
kreuzers a pound as beef; and when her flesh has disappeared, her
bones, after being ground at the mill, once again appear upon her
master&rsquo;s fields, to cheer, manure, and enrich them.</p>

<p>As, quite in love with cows, I was returning from the harvest, I
met the Nassau letter-cart, one of the cheapest carriages for its
purpose that can well be conceived. It consists of a pair of high
wheels connected by a short axle, upon which are riveted a few
boards framed together in the form of a small shallow box; in this
little coffin the letter-bag is buried, and upon it, like a monument,
sits a light boy dressed in the uniform of a Nassau postillion, who
with a trumpet in one hand, a long whip in the other, and the reins
sporting loose under his feet, starts as if he deliberately meant mischief,
intending to get well over his ground; and there being
scarcely any weight to carry, the horse really might proceed as a
mail-coach horse ought to go; but that horrible Punch and Judy
trumpet upsets the whole arrangement, for as the thing is very
heavy, the child soon takes two hands to it instead of one, when
down goes the whip, and from that moment the picture, which
promised to be a good one, is spoiled.</p>

<p>The letter-bag crawls, like a reptile, along the road; while the
boy, amusing himself with his plaything, reminds one of those
&ldquo;nursery rhymes&rdquo; which say,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;And with rings on his fingers, and bells on his toes,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We shall have music wherever he goes.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>It is quite provoking to see a government carriage in its theory
so simply imagined, and so cleverly adapted to its purpose, thus
completely ruined in its practice. Music may be, and indeed is,
very delightful in its way; but a tune is one thing&mdash;speed another;
and it always seems to me a pity that the Duke of Nassau should
allow these two substantives to be so completely confounded in his
dominions.</p>

<p>How admirably does the long tin horn of the guard of one of
our mail-coaches perform its blunt duty!&mdash;a single blast is sufficient
to remove the obstruction of an old gentleman in his gig&mdash;two are
generally enough for a heavy cart&mdash;three for a waggon&mdash;and half-a-dozen
slowly and sternly applied, are always sufficient to awaken
the snoring keeper of a turnpike-gate&mdash;in short, to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Break his bands of sleep asunder,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And rouse him like a rattling peal of thunder.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Hark! hark! the horrid sound<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Has raised up his head, as awaked from the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And amazed he stares around!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The gala turn-out of our mail-coaches on the King&rsquo;s birth-day,
I always think must strike foreigners more than anything else in our
country with the sterling solid integrity of the English character.
To see so many well-bred horses in such magnificent condition&mdash;so
many well-built carriages&mdash;so many excellent drivers, and such
a corps of steady, quiet, resolute-looking men as guards, each
wearing, as well as every coachman, the King&rsquo;s own livery&mdash;all
this must silently point out, even to our most jealous enemies, not
only the wealth of the country, but the firm basis on which it
stands; in short, it must prove to them most undeniably, that there
is no one thing in England which, throughout the land, is treated
with so much universal attention and respect, as the honest, speedy,
and safe delivery of the letters and commercial correspondence of
the country. Nevertheless, if our English coachmen were to be
allowed, instead of attending to their horses, to play on trumpets
as they proceeded, we should, as in the Duchy of Nassau, soon
pay very dearly for their music.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SUNSET" id="THE_SUNSET">THE SUNSET.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> had been hot all day&mdash;the roads had been dusty&mdash;the ground,
as one trod upon it, had felt warm&mdash;the air was motionless&mdash;animal
as well as vegetable life appeared weak and exhausted&mdash;Nature
herself seemed parched and thirsty&mdash;the people on the
promenade, as it got hotter and hotter, had walked slower and
slower, until they were now crawling along as unwillingly as if
they had been marching to their graves. The world, as if from
apathy, was coming to a stand still&mdash;Langen-Schwalbach itself
appeared to be fainting away, when the evening sun, having
rested for a moment on the western height, gradually vanished
from our sight.</p>

<p>His red tyrannical rays had hardly left our pale abject faces,
when all people suddenly revived; like a herd of fawning courtiers
who had been kept trembling before their king, they felt that, left
to themselves, they could now breathe, and think, and stamp their
feet. Parasols, one after another, were shut up&mdash;the pedestrians
on the promenade freshened their pace&mdash;even fat patients, who had
long been at anchor on the benches, began to show symptoms of
getting under weigh&mdash;every leaf seemed suddenly to be enjoying
the cool gentle breeze which was now felt stealing up the valley;
until, in a very few minutes, everything in Nature was restored to
life and enjoyment.</p>

<p>It was the hour for returning to my &ldquo;hof,&rdquo; but the air as it blew
into my window was so delightfully refreshing, and so irresistibly
inviting, that I and my broad-brimmed hat went out <i>tête-à-tête</i> to
enjoy it. As we passed the red pond of iron water, opposite to the
great &ldquo;Indian Hof,&rdquo; which comes from the strong Stahl brunnen,
having nothing to do, I lingered for some time watching the horses
that were brought there. After having toiled through the excessive
heat of the day, any water would have been agreeable to them; but
the nice, cool, strengthening, effervescing mixture into which they
were now led, seemed to be so exceedingly delightful, that they
were scarcely up to their knees before they made a strong attempt
to drink: but the rule being that they should first half walk and half
swim two or three times round the pond, this cleansing or ablution
was no sooner over&mdash;the reins were no sooner loosened&mdash;when
down went their heads into the red cooling pool; and one had then
only to look at the horses&rsquo; eyes to appreciate their enjoyment.
With the whole of their mouths and nostrils immersed, they seemed
as if they fancied they could drink the pond dry; however, the
greedy force with which they held their heads down gradually relaxed,
until, at last, up they were raised, with an aspiration which
seemed to say, &ldquo;We can hold no more!&rdquo; In about ten seconds,
however, their noses again dropped to the surface, but only to play
with an element which seemed now to be useless&mdash;so completely
had one single draught altered its current value! As I stood at the
edge of this pond, leaning over the rail, mentally participating
with the horses in the luxury they were enjoying, a violent shower
of rain came on; yet, before I had hurried fifty yards for an umbrella,
it had ceased. These little showers are exceedingly common
amongst the hills of Nassau in the evenings of very hot days.
From the power of the sun, the valleys during the day are filled
brimful with a steam, or exhalation, which no sooner loses its
parent, the sun, than the cold condenses it; and then, like the
tear on the cheek of a child that has suddenly missed its mother,
down it falls in heavy drops, and the next instant&mdash;smiles again.</p>

<p>As the air was very agreeable, I wandered up the hilly road
which leads to Bad-Ems; and then, strolling into a field of corn,
which had been just cut, I continued to climb the mountain, until,
turning round, I found, as I expected, that I had attained just the
sort of view I wanted; but it would be impossible to describe to
the reader the freshness of the scene. Beneath was the long scrambling
village of the Langen-Schwalbach, the slates of which, absolutely
blooming from the shower they had just received, looked so
very clean and fresh, that for some time my eyes quite enjoyed
rambling from one roof to the next, and then glancing from one
extremity of the town to the other;&mdash;they had been looking at hot
dazzling objects all day&mdash;I thought I never should be able to raise
them from the cool blue wet slates. However, as the light rapidly
faded, the landscape itself soon became equally refreshing, for the
dry parched corn-fields assumed a richer hue, the green crops
seemed bending under dew, and the whole picture, hills, town, and
all, appeared so newly painted, that the colours from Nature&rsquo;s brush
were too fresh to be dry. All of a sudden, majestically rolling up
the valley, was seen a misty vapour, which, at last, reaching the
houses, rolled from roof to roof, until it hovered over, or rather
rested upon the whole town, and this was no sooner the case than
the slates seemed all to have vanished!</p>

<p>In vain I looked for them, for the cloud exactly matching them in
colour had so completely disguised them, that they formed nothing
now but the base or foundation of the misty fabric which rested
upon them. Instead of a blue town, Langen-Schwalbach now appeared
to be a white one; for, the roofs no longer attracting attention,
the shining walls burst into notice, and a serpentine line of
glistening patches, nearly resembling a ridge of snow, clearly
marked out the shape and limits of the town; but as, in this elevated
country, there is little or no twilight, the features of the picture
again rapidly faded, until even this white line was hardly to be
seen; corn-fields could now scarcely be distinguished from green
crops&mdash;all became dark&mdash;and the large forest on the south hills, as
well as the small woods which are scattered on the heights, had so
completely lost their colour, that they appeared to be immense black
pits or holes. In a short time every thing beneath me was lost;
and sitting on the ground, leaning against seven sheaves of corn
piled up together, I was enjoying the sublime serenity, the mysterious
uncertainty of the scene before me, when another very beautiful
change took place!</p>

<p>I believe I have already told the reader that, beside myself, there
were about 1200 strangers in the little village of Langen-Schwalbach.
Of course every hof was fully inhabited, and, as soon as
darkness prevailed, the effect produced by each house being suddenly
and almost simultaneously lighted up, was really quite romantic.
In every direction, sometimes at the top of one hof, then
at the bottom of another, lights burst into existence&mdash;the eye attracted,
eagerly flew from one to another, until, from the number
which burst into life, it became quite impossible to attend to each.
The bottom of the valley, like the dancing of fire-flies, was sparkling
in the most irregular succession; till, in a short time, this fantastic
confusion vanished, and every room (there being no shutters)
having its light, Langen-Schwalbach was once again restored
to view&mdash;each house, and every story of each house, being now
clearly defined by a regular and very pleasing illumination; and
while, seated in utter darkness, I gazed at the gay sparkling scene
before me, I could not help feeling that, of all the beautiful contrasts
in Nature, there can be no one more vivid than the sudden change
between darkness and light. How weary we should be of eternal
sunshine,&mdash;how gloomy would it be to grope through one&rsquo;s life in
utter darkness, and yet what loveliness do each of these, by contrast,
impart to the other! On the heights above the village, how
magnificent was the darkness after a hot sun-shining day; and
then, again, how lovely was the twinkling even of tallow-candles,
when they suddenly burst upon this darkness! Yet it is with these
two ingredients that Nature works up all her pictures; and, as Paganini&rsquo;s
tunes all come out of two strings of cat-gut, and two of the
entrails of a kitten, so do all the varieties which please our eyes
proceed from a mixture in different proportions of light and shade;
and, indeed, in the moral world, it is the chiaro-oscuro, the brightness
and darkness of which alone form the happiness of our existence.
What would prosperity be, if there was no such sorrow
as adversity? what would health be if sickness did not exist?
and what would be the smile of an approving conscience if
there was not the torment of repentance writhing under guilt?
But I will persecute the reader no longer with the reflections which
occurred to me, as I sat in a wheat-field, gazing on the lights of
Langen-Schwalbach. Good or bad, they managed to please me;
however, after remaining in darkness, till it became much colder
than was agreeable, I wandered back to my hof, entered my dormitory,
and my head having there found its pillow, as I extinguished
my candle, I mumbled to myself&mdash;&ldquo;There goes one of the tallow
stars of Langen-Schwalbach!&mdash;Sic transit gloria mundi!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was lying prostrate, still awake&mdash;and (there being no shutters
to the window at the foot of the bed) I was looking at some oddly-shaped,
tall, acute-angled, slated roofs, glistening in the light of the
round full moon, which was hanging immediately above them. The
scene was delightfully silent and serene. Occasionally I faintly
heard a distant footstep approaching, until treading heavily under
the window, its sound gradually diminished, till all again was silent.
Sometimes a cloud passing slowly across the moon would veil the
roofs in darkness; and then, again, they would suddenly burst upon
the eye, in silvery light, shining brighter than ever. As somewhat
fatigued I lay half enjoying this scene, and half dozing, I suddenly
heard, apparently close to me, the scream of a woman, which really
quite electrified me!</p>

<p>On listening it was repeated, when, jumping out of bed and opening
the door, I heard it again proceeding from a room at the distant
end of the passage; and such was the violence of its tone, that
my impression was&mdash;&ldquo;the lady&rsquo;s room is on fire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is something in the piercing shriek of a woman in distress
which produces an irresistible effect on the featherless biped, called
man; and, in rushing to her assistance, he performs no duty&mdash;he
exercises no virtue&mdash;but merely obeys an instinctive impulse which
has been benevolently imparted to him&mdash;not for his own good, but
for the safety and protection of a weaker and a better sex.</p>

<p>But although this feeling exists so powerfully chez nous, yet
it has not by nature been imparted to common-place garments, such
as coats, black figured silk waistcoats, rusty knee-breeches, nor
even to easy shoes, blue worsted stockings, or such like; and, therefore,
while, by an irresistible attraction which I could not possibly
counteract, obeying the mysterious impulse of my nature, I rushed
along the passage, these base, unchivalric garments remained coldly
dangling over the back of a chair: in short, I followed the laws of
my nature&mdash;they, theirs.</p>

<p>With some difficulty, having succeeded in bursting open the door
just as a fifth shriek was repeated, I rushed in, and there, sitting up
in her bed&mdash;her soft arms most anxiously extended towards me&mdash;her
countenance expressing an agony of fear&mdash;sat a young lady, by
no means ill-favoured, and aged (as near as I could hastily calculate)
about twenty-one!</p>

<p>Almost in hysterics, she began, in German, to tell a long incoherent
story; and though, with calm, natural dignity, I did what I
could to quiet her, the tears rushed into her eyes&mdash;she then almost
in convulsions began, with her hands under the bed-clothes, to
scratch her knees, then shrieked again; and I do confess that I was
altogether at a loss to conceive what in the sacred name of virtue
was the matter with the young lady, when, by her repeating several
times the word &ldquo;Ratten! Ratten!!&rdquo; I at once comprehended that
there were (or that the amiable young person fancied that there
were)&mdash;<i>rats in her bed</i>!</p>

<p>The dog Billy, as well as many puppies of less name, would instantly,
perhaps, have commenced a vigorous attack; rats, however,
are reptiles I am not in the habit either of hunting or destroying.</p>

<p>The young lady&rsquo;s aunt, an elderly personage, now appeared at
the door, in her night-clothes, as yellow and as sallow as if she had
just risen from the grave; peeping over her shoulder, stood our
landlady&rsquo;s blooming daughter in her bed-gown&mdash;Leonhard, the son
<i>cum multis aliis</i>. What they could all have thought of the scene&mdash;what
they could have thought of my strange, gaunt, unadorned
appearance&mdash;what they could have thought of the niece&rsquo;s screams&mdash;and
what they would have thought had I deigned to tell them I
had come to her bedside merely to catch rats&mdash;it was out of my
power to divine: however, the fact was, I cared not a straw what
they thought; but, seeing that my presence was not requisite, I
gravely left the poor innocent sufferer to tell her own story. &ldquo;Ratten!
Ratten!!&rdquo; was its theme; and, long before her fears subsided,
my mind, as well as its body, were placidly intranced in sleep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> an old man, one of the most delightful features in a German
watering-place, is the ease with which he can associate, in the most
friendly manner, with all his brother and sister water-bibbers,
without the fatigue of speaking one single word.</p>

<p>Almost every glass of water you get from the brunnen adds, at
least, one to the list of your acquaintance. Merely touching a
man&rsquo;s elbow is sufficient to procure from him a look of goodfellowship,
which, though it does not inconveniently grow into a bow,
or even into a smile, is yet always afterwards displayed in his physiognomy
whenever it meets yours. If, as you are stretching out
your glass, you retire but half a stride, to allow a thirsting lady
to step forward, you clearly see, whensoever you afterwards meet
her, that the slight attention is indelibly recorded in your favour.
Even running against a German produces, as it were by collision,
a spark of kind feeling, which, like a star in the heavens, twinkles
in his serene countenance whenever you behold it. Smile only
once upon a group of children, and the little urchins bite their lips,
vainly repressing their joy whenever afterwards you meet them.</p>

<p>Shrouded in this delightful taciturnity, my list of acquaintances at
Langen-Schwalbach daily increased, until I found myself on just
the sort of amicable terms with almost everybody, which, to my
present taste, is the most agreeable. In early life young people
(if I recollect right) are never quite happy, unless they are either
talking, or writing letters to their fellow-creatures. Whenever,
even as strangers, they get together, everything that happens or
passes seems to engender conversation&mdash;even when they have
parted, there is no end to epistolary valedictions, and creation
itself loses half its charms, unless the young beholder has some
companion with whom the loveliness of the picture may be shared
and enjoyed.</p>

<p>But old age I find stiffens, first of all, the muscles of the tongue;
indeed, as man gradually decays, it seems wisely provided by
Nature that he should be willing to be dumb, before time obliges
him to be deaf: in short the mind, however voraciously it might
once have searched for food, at last instinctively prefers rumination,
to seeking for more.</p>

<p>By young people I shall be thought selfish, yet I do confess that
I enjoy silence, because my own notions now suit me best; other
people&rsquo;s opinions, like their shoes, don't fit me, and however ill-constructed
or old-fashioned my own may really be, yet use has made
them easy: my sentiments, ugly as they may seem, don't pinch, and I
therefore feel I had rather not exchange them; the one or two
friends I have lost rank in my memory better than any I can ever
hope to gain: in fact, I had rather not replace them, and at Langen-Schwalbach,
as there was no necessity for a passing stranger like myself
to set up a fine new acquaintance with people he would probably
never see again, I considered that with my eyes and ears open, my
tongue might harmlessly enjoy natural and delightful repose.</p>

<p>But there is a perverseness in human nature, which it is quite
out of my power to account for; and strange as it may sound, it is
nevertheless too true, that the only person at Langen-Schwalbach
I felt desirous to address, was the only individual who seemed to
shun every human being.</p>

<p>He was a withered, infirm man, who appeared to be tottering on
the brink of his grave; and I had long remarked that, for some
reason or other, he studiously avoided the brunnen until every
person had left it. He spoke to no one&mdash;looked at no one&mdash;but as
soon as he had swallowed off his dose, he retired to a lone bench,
on which, with both hands leaning upon his ivory-handled cane,
he was always to be seen sitting with his eyes sorrowfully fixed on
the ground. Although the weather was, to every person but himself,
oppressively hot, he was constantly muffled up in a thick cloak, and
I think I must have passed him a hundred times before I detected,
one exceedingly warm day, that underneath it there hung upon
his left breast the Cross of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem. As,
ages ago, I had myself passed many a hot summer on the parched,
barren rock of Malta,&mdash;always, however, feeling much interested
in the history of its banished knights,&mdash;I at once fully comprehended
why the poor old gentleman&rsquo;s body was so chilly, and why
his heart felt so chilled with the world. By many slow and scientific
approaches which it would be only tedious to detail, I at last
managed, without driving him from his bench, most quietly to establish
myself at his side, and then by coughing when he coughed,&mdash;sighing
when he sighed,&mdash;and by other (I hope innocent) artifices,
I at last ventured in a <i>sotto voce</i> to mumble to him something
about the distant island in which apparently all his youthful feelings
lay buried. The words Valetta, Civitta Vecchia, Floriana, Cottonera,
&amp;c., as I pronounced them, produced, by a sort of galvanic
influence, groans&mdash;ejaculations&mdash;short sentences, until at last he
began to show me frankly without disguise the real colour of his
mind. Poor man! like his eye it was jaundiced&mdash;&ldquo;nullis medicabilis
herbis!&rdquo; I could not at all extract from him what rank,
title, or situation he held in the ancient order, but I could too clearly
see that he looked upon its extinction as the Persian would look
upon the annihilation of the sun. Creation he fancied had been
robbed of its colours,&mdash;Christianity he thought had lost its heart,&mdash;and
he attributed every political ailment on the surface of the
globe to the non-existence of the Knights Hospitallers of St. John
of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>For several hours I patiently listened to his unhappy tale; for as
lamentations of all sorts are better out of the human heart than in
it, I felt that as the vein was open, my patient could not be encouraged
to bleed too freely: without therefore once contradicting
him, I allowed his feelings to flow uninterrupted, and by the time
he had pumped himself dry, I was happy to observe that he was
certainly much better for the operation. On leaving him, however,
my own pent-up view of the case, and his, continued for the
remainder of the day bubbling and quarrelling with each other in
my mind. Therefore, to satisfy myself before I went to bed, I
drew out in black and white the following sketch of what has
always appeared to me to be a fair, impartial history of these&mdash;Knights
of Malta.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Mediterranean forms a curious and beautiful feature in the
picture of the commercial world. By dint of money and shipping we
laboriously bring to England the produce of the most distant regions,
but the commerce of the whole globe seems to have a natural
or instinctive tendency to flow, almost of its own accord, into the
Mediterranean Sea. Beginning with the great Atlantic Ocean,
which connects the old world with the new, we know that, over
that vast expanse, the prevailing wind is one which blows from
America towards Europe; and, moreover, that the waters of the
Atlantic are, without any apparent return, everlastingly flowing
into the narrow straits of Gibraltar. When the produce of America,
therefore, is shipped for the Mediterranean, in general terms
it may be asserted that wind and tide are in its favour.</p>

<p>Across the trackless deserts of Africa caravans from various
parts of the interior are constantly toiling through the sand towards
the waters of this inland sea. The traveller who goes up the Nile
is doomed, we all know, to stem its torrent, but the produce of
Egypt and the triple harvest of that luxuriant land is no sooner
embarked, than of its own accord it glides majestically towards
this favoured sea; and there is truth and nothing speculative in
still further remarking, that this very harvest is absolutely produced
by the slime or earth of Abyssinian and other most remote mountains,
which by the laws of nature has calmly floated 1200 miles through
a desert to top-dress or manure Egypt, that garden which eventually
supplies so many of the inhabitants of the Mediterranean with corn.</p>

<p>Again, the Red Sea is a passage apparently created to connect
Europe with the great Eastern world; and as the power of steam
gradually increases in its stride, it is evident that by this gulf, or
natural canal, much of the produce of India eventually will easily
flow into the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

<p>Finally, it might likewise be shown, that much of the commerce
of Asia Minor and Europe, either by great rivers or otherwise, naturally
moves towards this central point; but besides these sources
of external wealth, the Mediterranean, as we all know, is most romantically
studded with an Archipelago and other beautiful islands,
the inhabitants of which have the power not only of trading on a
large scale with every quarter of the globe, but of carrying on in
small open boats a sort of little village commerce of their own.
Among the inhabitants of this sea are to be found at this moment
the handsomest specimens of the human race; and if a person not
satisfied with the present and future tenses of life, should prefer
reflecting or rather ruminating on the past, with antiquarian rapture
he may wander over these waters from Carthage to Egypt,
Tyre, Sidon, Rhodes, Troy, Ephesus, Athens, Corinth, Argos, Syracuse,
Rome, &amp;c., until tired of his flight he may rest upon one of
the ocean-beaten pillars of Hercules&mdash;and seated there, may most
truly declare that the history of the Mediterranean is like the picture
of its own waves beneath him, which one after another he
sees to rise, break, and sink.</p>

<p>In the history of this little sea, in what melancholy succession has
nation and empire risen and fallen, flourished and decayed; and if the
magnificent architectural ruins of these departed states mournfully
offer to the traveller any political moral at all, is it not that homely
one which the most common tomb-stone of our country churchyard
preaches to the peasant who reads it?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;As I am now, so you will be,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Therefore prepare to follow me!&rdquo;</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>However, fully admitting the truth of the lesson which history and
experience thus offer to us&mdash;admitting that no one can presume to
declare which of the great Mediterranean powers is doomed to be
the next to suffer&mdash;or what new point is next to burst into importance;
yet if a man were forced to select a position which, in spite
of fate or fortune, feuds or animosities, has been, and ever must be,
the nucleus of commerce, he would find that in the Mediterranean
Sea that point, as nearly as possible, would be the little island of
Malta; and the political importance of this possession being now
generally appreciated, it is curious rapidly to run over the string of
little events which have gradually prepared, fortified, and delivered
this valuable arsenal and fortress to the British flag.</p>

<p>In the early ages of navigation, when men hardly dared to lose
sight of the shore, ignorantly trembling if they were not absolutely
hugging the very danger which we now most strenuously avoid, it
may be easily conceived that a little barren island, scarcely twenty
miles in length or twelve in breadth, was of little use or importance.
It is true, that on its north coast there was a spit or narrow tongue
of land (about a mile in length and a few hundred yards in
breadth), on each side of which were a series of connected bays,
now forming two of the most magnificent harbours in the world;
but in the ages of which we speak this great outline was a nautical
hieroglyphic which sailors could not decipher. Accustomed to hide
their Lilliputian vessels and fleets in bays and creeks on the same
petty scale as themselves, they did not comprehend or appreciate
the importance of these immense Brobdignag recesses, nor did
they admire the great depth of water which they contained; and
as in ancient warfare, when warriors used javelins, arrows and
stones, scalding each other with hot sand, the value of a position
adapted to the present ranges of our shot and shells would not have
been understood, in like manner was the importance of so large
a harbour equally imperceptible; and that Malta could have had
no very great reputation is proved by the fact, that it is even to
this day among the learned a subject of dispute, whether it was
upon this island, or upon Melita in the Adriatic, that St. Paul was
shipwrecked. Now if either had been held in any particular estimation,
the question of the shipwreck would not now be any subject
of doubt.</p>

<p>As navigators became more daring, and as their vessels, increasing
in size, required more water and provisions, &amp;c., Malta fell into
the hands of various masters. At last, when Charles V. conquered
Sicily and Naples, he offered it to those warriors of Christendom,
those determined enemies of the Turks and Corsairs&mdash;the Knights
Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem. This singular band of men,
distinguished by their piebald vow of heroism and celibacy, had,
after a most courageous resistance, been just overpowered by an
army of 300,000 Saracens, who, under Solyman II., had driven
them from the island of Rhodes, which had been occupied by their
Order 213 years. Animated by the most noble blood of Europe
which flowed in their veins&mdash;thirsting for revenge&mdash;yet homeless
and destitute, it may easily be conceived that these brave, enthusiastic
men would most readily have accepted almost any spot on
which they could once again establish their busy hive: yet so little
was the importance of Malta, even at that time, understood, so arid
was its surface, and so burning was its rock, that, after minutely
surveying it, their commissioners made a report to Charles V.,
which must ever be regarded as a most affecting document; for although
the Knights of Malta were certainly in their day the &ldquo;bravest
of the brave,&rdquo; although by that chivalric oath which bound them
together, they had deliberately sworn &ldquo;<i>never to count the number
of their enemies</i>,&rdquo; yet after the strong, proud position which they
had held at Rhodes, it was only hard fate and stern necessity that
could force them to seek refuge on a rock upon which there was
scarcely soil enough to plant their standard. But though honour
has been justly termed &ldquo;an empty bubble,&rdquo; yet to all men&rsquo;s eyes its
colours are so very beautiful, that they allure and encourage us to
contend with difficulties which no other advocate could persuade us
to encounter; and so it was that the Knights of Malta, seeing they
had no alternative, sternly accepted the hot barren home that was
offered to them, and in the very teeth, and before the beard of their
barbarous enemy, these lions of the Cross landed and established
themselves in their new den.</p>

<p>When men have once made up their minds to stand against adversity,
the scene generally brightens; for danger, contrary to the
rules of drawing, is less in the foreground than in the perspective&mdash;difficulties
of all sorts being magnified by the misty space which
separates us from them; and accordingly the knights were no sooner
established at Malta, than they began to find out the singular advantages
it possessed.</p>

<p>The whole island being a rock of freestone, which could be
worked with peculiar facility, materials for building palaces and
houses, suited to the dignity of the Order, existed everywhere on
the spot; and it moreover became evident, that by merely quarrying
out the rock, according to the rules of military science, they
would not only obtain materials for building, but that, in fact, the
more they excavated for their town, the deeper would be the ditch
of its fortress. Animated by this double reward, the knights commenced
their operations, or, in military language, they &ldquo;broke
ground;&rdquo; and, without detailing how often the rising fortress was
jealously attacked by their barbarous and relentless enemies, or
how often its half-raised walls were victoriously cemented with the
blood of Christians and of Turks, it will be sufficient merely to observe,
that before the island had been in possession of the Order
one century, it assumed very nearly the same astonishing appearance
which it now affords&mdash;a picture and an example, proving to
the whole world what can be done by courage, firmness, and perseverance.</p>

<p>The narrow spit or tongue of barren rock which on the north
side of the island separated the two great harbours, was scarped
in every part, so as to render it inaccessible by sea, and on the
isthmus, or only side on which it could be approached by land,
demi-lunes, ravelins, counter-guards, bastions, and cavaliers, were
seen towering one above another on so gigantic a scale, that, as a
single datum, it may be stated, that the wall of the escarp is from
130 to 150 feet in height, being nearly five times the height of that
of a regular fortress. On this narrow tongue of land, thus fortified,
arose the city of Valetta, containing a palace for its Grand
Master; and almost equally magnificent residences for its knights,
the whole forming at this day one of the finest cities in the world.
On every projecting point of the various beautiful bays contained in
each of the two great harbours, separated from each other by the
town of Valetta, forts were built flanking each other, yet all offering
a concentrating fire upon any and every part of the port; and
when a vessel labouring, heaving, pitching, and tossing, in a heavy
gale of wind, now suddenly enters the great harbour of Malta, the
sudden lull&mdash;the unexpected calm&mdash;the peaceful stillness which prevails
on its deep unruffled surface, is most strangely contrasted in
the mind of the stranger with the innumerable guns which, bristling
in every direction from batteries one above another, seem fearfully
to announce to him that he is in the chamber of death&mdash;in a slaughter-house
from which there is no escape, and that, if he should
dare to offer insult, although he has just escaped from the raging
of the elements, the silence around him is that of the grave!</p>

<p>It was from the city and harbour of Valetta, in the state
above described,&mdash;it was from this proud citadel of Christianity,
that the Knights of Malta continued for some time sallying forth
to carry on their uncompromising hostility against the Turks
and against the corsairs of Algiers and Tripoli; but the brilliant
victories they gained, and the bloody losses they sustained,
must be passed over, as it is already time to hurry their history to
a close.</p>

<p>The fact is, the Knights Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem
gradually outlived the passions and objects which called them into
existence, and their Order decayed for want of that nourishment
which, during so many ages, it received from the sympathy, countenance,
and applause of Christendom. In short, as mankind had
advanced in civilization, its angry, savage, intolerant passions had
gradually subsided, and thus the importance of the Order unavoidably
faded with its utility. There was nothing premature in its
decay&mdash;it had lived long enough. The holy, or rather unholy, war,
with all its unchristian feelings, having long since subsided, it would
have been inconsistent in the great nations of Europe to have professed
a general disposition for peace, or to have entered into any
treaty with the Turks, while at the same time they encouraged an
Order which was bent on their extermination.</p>

<p>The vow of celibacy, once the pride of the Order, became, in a
more enlightened age, a mill-stone round its neck; it attracted ridicule&mdash;it
created guilt&mdash;the sacred oath was broken; and although
the head, the heart, and the pockets, of a soldier may be as light as
the pure air he breathes, yet he can never truly be reported &ldquo;fit for
duty&rdquo; if his conscience or his stomach be too heavily laden. In
short, in two words, the Order of St. John of Jerusalem was no
longer suited to the times; and Burke had already exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;<i>The
age of chivalry has fled!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the year 1798, this Order, after having existed nearly 700 years,
signed its own death-warrant, and in the face of Europe died ignominiously&mdash;&ldquo;<i>felo
de se</i>.&rdquo; On the 9th of June, in that year, their
island was invaded by the French; and although, as Napoleon
justly remarked, to have excluded him it would have been only
necessary to have shut the gates, Valetta was surrendered by treachery,
the depravity of which will be best explained by the following
extract from a statement made by the Maltese deputies:&mdash;&ldquo;No
one is ignorant that the plan of the invasion of Malta was projected
in Paris, and confided to the principal knights of the Order
resident at Malta. Letters in cyphers were incessantly passing and
repassing, without however alarming the suspicions of the deceased
Grand Master, or the Grand Master Hompesch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as the French were in possession of the city, harbours,
and impregnable fortresses of Valetta, they began, as usual, to
mutilate from the public buildings everything which bore the stamp
of nobility, or recalled to mind the illustrious actions which had
been performed. The arms of the Order, as well as those of the
principal knights, were effaced from the palace and principal dwelling-houses;
however, as the knights had sullied their own reputation,
and had cast an indelible blot on their own escutcheons, they
had but little right to complain that the image of their glory was
thus insulted, when they themselves had been guilty of the murder
of its spirit. The Order of St. John of Jerusalem being now worn
out and decayed, its elements were scattered to the winds. The
knight who were not in the French interest were ordered to quit
the island in three days, and a disgraceful salary was accepted by
the Grand Master Hompesch. Those knights who had favoured
the French were permitted to remain, but, exposed to the rage of
the Maltese, and unprotected by their false friends, some fled, some
absolutely perished from want, but all were despised and hated.</p>

<p>In the little theatre of Malta the scene is about to change, and
the British soldier now marches upon its stage! On the 2d of
September, 1798, the island was blockaded by the English, and the
fortifications being absolutely impregnable, it became necessary to
attempt the reduction of the place by famine.</p>

<p>For two years most gallantly did the French garrison undergo
the most horrid suffering and imprisonment&mdash;steadily and cheerfully
did they submit to every possible privation&mdash;their stock of
spirits, wine, meat, bread, &amp;c., doled out in the smallest possible
allowances, gradually diminished until all came to end. Sooner
than strike, they then subsisted upon the flesh of their horses,
mules, and asses; and when these also were consumed, and when
they had eaten not only their cats, but the rats which infested the
houses, drains, &amp;c., in great numbers&mdash;when, from long-protracted
famine, the lamp of life was absolutely expiring in the socket;
in short, having, as one of their kings once most nobly exclaimed,
&ldquo;lost all but their honour,&rdquo; these brave men&mdash;with nerves unshaken,
with reputation unsullied, and with famine proudly painted in
their lean, emaciated countenances&mdash;on the 4th of September,
1800, surrendered the place to that nation which Napoleon has
since termed &ldquo;the most powerful, the most constant, and the
most generous of his enemies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the long-winded game of war which France and England
lately played together, our country surely never made any
better move than when she thus laid hold of Malta. Even if the
island had been in the rude state in which it was delivered to the
knights of Jerusalem, still, to a maritime power like England, such
splendid harbours in the Mediterranean would have been a most
valuable conquest; but when we not only appreciate their noble
outline, but consider the gigantic and expensive manner in which
this town has been impregnably fortified, as well as furnished with
tanks, subterraneous stores, bomb-proof magazines, most magnificent
barracks, palaces, &amp;c., it is quite delightful to reflect on the
series of events which have led to such a well-assorted alliance
between two of the strongest harbours in the world and the first
maritime power on the globe.</p>

<p>If, like the French, we had taken the island from the knights,
however degraded, worn out, and useless their Order might have
become, yet Europe in general, and France in particular, might
always have reproached us, and, for aught we know, our own
consciences might have become a little tender on the subject.
But the delightful truth is, that no power in Europe can breathe a
word or a syllable against our possession of the island of Malta&mdash;it
is an honour in open daylight we have fairly won, and I humbly
say, long, very long, may we wear it!</p>

<p>With respect to the Maltese themselves, I just at this moment
recollect a trifling story which will, I think, delineate their character
with tolerable accuracy.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_RENEGADE" id="THE_RENEGADE">THE RENEGADE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> all the little unhappy prejudices which in different parts of
the globe it has been my fortune, or rather misfortune, to witness,
I nowhere remember to have met with a deeper-rooted hatred or
a more implacable animosity than existed, some twenty or thirty
years ago, in the hearts of the Maltese towards the Turks. In all
warm glowing latitudes, human passions, good as well as bad,
may be said to stand at least at that degree which on Fahrenheit&rsquo;s
scale would be denoted &ldquo;fever heat;&rdquo; and steam itself can hardly
be more different from ice,&mdash;the Bengal tiger springing on his prey
cannot form a greater contrast to that half-frozen fisherman the
white bear, as he sits on his iceberg sucking his paws,&mdash;than are
the passions of hot countries when compared with the cold torpid
feelings of the inhabitants of the northern regions of the globe.</p>

<p>In all parts of the Mediterranean I found passions of all sorts
very violent, but, without any exception, that which, at the period
I refer to, stood uppermost in the scale, was bigotry. Besides the
eager character which belonged to their latitude, one might naturally
expect that the Maltese, from being islanders, would be rather
more prejudiced than their continental neighbours; however, in
addition to these causes, when I was among them, they really had
good reason to dislike the Turks, who during the time of the knights
had been <i>ex officio</i> their constant and most bitter enemies.</p>

<p>Whether these fine knights of Jerusalem conquered the Turks
or were defeated, the Maltese on board their galleys (like the
dwarf who fought with the giant) always suffered: besides this,
their own little trading vessels were constantly captured by the
Turks, the crews being not only maltreated and tortured, but often
in cold blood cruelly massacred; in short, if there was any bad
feeling in the heart of a Maltese, which the history of his island, as
well as every bitter recollection of his life, seemed naturally to nourish,
it was an implacable hatred for the Turks; and that this sad
theory was most fully supported by the fact, became evident the instant
one observed a Maltese, on the commonest subject, utter that
hated, accursed word, <i>Turco</i>, or Turk. The sort of petty convulsion
of the mind with which this dissyllable was delivered was really
very remarkable, and the roll and flash of the eye&mdash;the little bullying
shake of the head&mdash;the slight stamp of the left foot&mdash;and the
twitch in the fingers of the right hand, reminded one for the moment
of the manner in which a French dragoon, when describing an
action, mentions that his regiment came on <i>sabre à la main</i>!&mdash;words
which, if you were to give him the universe, he could not
pronounce without grinding his teeth, much less with that cold-hearted
simplicity with which one of our soldiers would calmly say
&ldquo;sword in hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This hatred of the Maltese towards the Turks was a sort of cat
and dog picture which always attracted my notice; however, I
witnessed one example of it, on which occasion I felt very strongly
it was carried altogether beyond a joke.</p>

<p>One lovely morning&mdash;I remember it as if it were yesterday&mdash;there
had been a great religious festival in the island, which, as
usual, had caused a good deal of excitement, noise, and fever; and,
as a nation seldom allays its thirst without quarrelling, as soon as
the hot sun set, a great many still hotter disturbances took place.
In one of these rows, a party of Turks, justly or injustly, became
offended with the inhabitants; an affray occurred, and a Mahometan
having stabbed a Maltese, he was of course thrown into prison;
and in process of time, surrounded by a strong guard, he was led
into the Maltese court to be tried (<i>Anglicè</i> condemned) for the
offence. As he threaded his way through the crowd which had
assembled in those dirty passages and dark chambers that led to
the tribunal, the women shrunk back as the <i>Turco</i> passed them,
as if his very breath would have infected them with the plague;
while in the countenances of the men, as they leant forwards arresting
him in his progress, and almost touching him with their
brown faces, it was evident that they were all animated with but
one feeling and one desire, that is to say, hatred and revenge:
however, nothing was heard but a very slight murmur or groan,
and the prisoner was soon seen a little raised above the crowd,
trembling at the bar. He was a diminutive, mean-looking, ill-favoured
little fellow, dressed in the loose Turkish costume, with a
very small dirty white turban, the folds of which were deemed more
odious to the Christian eye than if they had been formed by the
wreathing body of the serpent. While the crowd were shouldering
each other, head peeping over head, and before the shuffling of
moving feet could be silenced, avvocati, or clerks, who sat in the
small space between the prisoner and the bench, were seen eagerly
mending their pens, and they had already dipped them into ink,
and the coarse, dirty, rough-edged paper on which they were to
write was folded and placed ready in front of them, before it was
possible to commence the trial.</p>

<p>The court was insufferably hot, and there was such a stench of
garlic and of clothing impregnated with the stale fumes of tobacco,
that one longed almost as much as the prisoner to escape into the
open air, while the sallow faces of the avvocati, clerks, and every
one connected with the duties of the court, showed how unhealthy,
as well as offensive, was the atmosphere which they breathed. On
the bench sat what one must call the Judges, but to an English
mind such a title but ill belonged to those who had only lately been
forced, most reluctantly, to expel torture from their code. Just
before Malta fell into the hands of the French and English, my own
servant, Giuseppe, had lived in the service of one of the Maltese
Judges; and among many horrors which he often very calmly described
to me (for he had witnessed them until he had become quite
accustomed to them), he told me that he had had constantly to pass
through a court in which were those who were doomed to ride upon
what was called the &ldquo;cavallo di legno,&rdquo; or wooden horse. With
weights attached to each foot he used to see them sitting bolt upright
on this sharp narrow ridge, with two torches burning within a few
inches of their naked chests and backs, in order that they should
relieve themselves by a change of attitude no longer than they
could endure the pain of leaning against the flame. But to return
to the court.</p>

<p>The trial of the Turk now began, and every rigid form was most
regularly followed. The accusation was read&mdash;the story was detailed&mdash;the
Maltese witnesses in great numbers one after another
corroborated almost in the same words the same statement&mdash;several
times when the prisoner was ordered to be silent, as by some ejaculation
he interrupted the thread of the narrative, did the eyes of
every being in court flash in anger and contempt upon him, their
countenances as suddenly returning to a smile as the evidence of
the witnesses proceeded with their criminatory details. At last,
the case being fully substantiated, the culprit was called upon for
his defence. Although a poor, mean, illiterate wretch, it is possible
he might have intended to have made a kind of a sort of a speech;
but when he came to the point, his heart failed him, and his lips
had only power to utter one single word.</p>

<p>Regardless of the crowd, as if it had not existed, looking as if he
thought there was no object in creation but the central Judge on
the bench, he fixed his eyes for some moments upon his cold, immoveable
countenance, until overpowered by his feelings, almost
sinking into the ground, he clasped his hands, and in an agony of
expression, which it is quite impossible to describe, he asked for
&ldquo;<em class="smcap">Mercy</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Nix standy! I don't understand ye!</i>&rdquo; said an old English
soldier one day, in the <i>Bois de Boulogne</i>, to a French general,
who, with much gesture and grimace, was telling in French, that
the English were acting against the laws of nations in thus cutting
down so beautiful a forest as the said <i>Bois de Boulogne</i>. &ldquo;<i>Nix
standy!</i>&rdquo; repeated the soldier, continuing to hack with all his might
at the young tree which he had almost cut down with his sabre.
The very same answer was strongly expressed in the countenance
of the Judge, to the petition of the unhappy Turk, who, had he been
in the desert of Africa, might just as well have asked merely for
the ocean, as, in a Maltese court, to have supplicated for <i>mercy</i>.
For some time the Judge sat in awful silence&mdash;then whispered a
few words to his colleagues&mdash;again all was silent: at last, when
some little forms had been observed, the Chief Judge pronounced
a sentence on the prisoner, which he might just as well have done
without his having endured the pain and anxiety of a long trial. It
is hardly worth while mentioning the sentence; for, of course, it
was that the Turco, being guilty of the murder of the Maltese, was
to be hanged by the neck till he was dead; every word of which
sentence was most ravenously devoured by the audience: and the
trial being now over, the prisoner was hurried away to his dungeon,
while the crowd eagerly rushed into the hot sunshine and open
air.</p>

<p>A very considerable time elapsed between the sentence and the
day fixed for execution. Where the prisoner was&mdash;what were
his feelings&mdash;how he was fed&mdash;&ldquo;and how he fared&mdash;no one knew,
and no one cared:&rdquo; however, on the last day of his existence, I
happened to be riding along Strada Forni, when I heard a bellowing
sort of a blast from a cow&rsquo;s horn, which I instantly knew to be
the signal that a fellow creature was going to the gallows. In any
country in the world, the monotonous moan which proceeds from
this wild uncouth instrument would be considered as extremely
harsh and disagreeable; but at Malta, where the ear has been constantly
accustomed to good Italian music, and to listen to nothing
more discordant than the lovely and love-making notes of the guitar,
this savage whoop was indescribably offensive, particularly being
accompanied by the knowledge that it was the death-march, and
the dirge of the murderer&mdash;&ldquo;the knell, that summoned him to
heaven or to hell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I rode towards Strada Reale, the principal street of Valetta,
down which the procession was proceeding, a dismal blast from
this horn was heard about every ten seconds; and, as it sounded
louder and louder, it was evident the procession was approaching.
At last, on coming to the corner of the street, I saw the culprit advancing
on his funeral car. The streets on both sides were lined
with spectators, and every window was filled with outstretched
figures and eager faces. In the middle of Strada Reale, preceding
the prisoner, were three or four mutes; while several others were
also begging in different parts of the town. These people, who
belonged to some of the principal Maltese families, were covered
from head to foot, with long loose robes of white linen, a couple of
holes being cut for their eyes. Their feet were bare, and to each
ancle was affixed a chain of such weight and length, that it was as
much as they could do to drag one leg after the other. In the right
hand they held a tin money-box, in the shape of a lantern, with
death&rsquo;s head and bloody bones painted upon it. A small slit in this
box received the copper contributions of the multitude; and, as
these mutes passed me in horrid triumph, shaking the box every
step they took (the rattling of the money forming a sort of savage
accompaniment to the deep clanking of their chains), they had
altogether an unearthly appearance, which certainly seemed less
to belong to heaven than to hell; however, the malefactor now
approached, and as soon as he came up to the corner of my street,
I, loosening my rein, rode for a few moments at his side, attracted
by one of the strangest scenes which I think I have ever beheld.
The man was half sitting, half reclining, on a sort of low, rattling,
iron vehicle, of an indescribable shape, which raised his head a
little above the level of the people; and the very moment I looked
him in the face, much of the secret history of what had passed since
the day of his condemnation was as legible in his countenance as
if it had been written there. He had been existing in some dark
place, for his complexion was blanched by absence from light&mdash;he
had evidently been badly fed, for there was famine in his sunken
features&mdash;his nerves were gone, for he was trembling&mdash;his health
had been materially impaired, either by suffering of body or mind,
for the man was evidently extremely ill&mdash;and last, though not least,
for some mysterious reason, either from an expectation of obtaining
mercy in this world or in the next, he had evidently abjured his
religion, for his dirty white turban was gone, and, very ill at his
ease, he sat, or rather reclined, in the clothes of a Christian!</p>

<p>The car on which he proceeded was surrounded by an immense
number of priests, belonging to the different churches of Valetta,
and apparently to those also of all the <i>casals</i> and villages in the
island. All angry feelings had most completely subsided; in their
minds, as well as in the minds of the people, the day was one only
of triumph and joy; and, intoxicated with the spirit of religious enthusiasm,
the priests were evidently beside themselves with joy at
having succeeded in the miraculous conversion which they had
effected. Shouldering and pushing each other with all their
strength, with outstretched arms, and earnest countenances, they
were all, in different attitudes and voices, calling upon the malefactor
to repeat the name of their own peculiar saint; some behind
him were trying to attract his notice by pulling his clothes, while
those before him, by dint of voice and gesture, were equally endeavouring
to catch his eye; and such a confused cry of &ldquo;Viva San
Tommaso!&rdquo; &ldquo;Viva San Giuseppe!&rdquo; &ldquo;Viva San Giovanni!&rdquo; &ldquo;Viva
San Paolo!&rdquo; I will not pretend to describe. It was, of course, impossible
for the wretch to comply with all their noisy demands;
yet, poor fellow, he did his best; and in a low faint voice, being
dreadfully exhausted by the jolting and shaking of the carriage, he
repeated &ldquo;Viva San Paolo!&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c., as he caught the eye of
the different priests. He had evidently no rule in these exclamations
which he uttered, for I observed that the strong brawny-shouldered
priests who got nearest to him, often made him repeat
the name of their saints twice, before the little bandy-legged
ones in the rear could get him to mention theirs once. As this
strange concert proceeded, it was impossible to help pitying the
poor culprit; for, if one had been travelling from one magnificent
palace to another, to be so jolted and tormented both in body and
mind when one was ill, would by any of us have been termed
dreadfully disagreeable; but for all this to happen to a man just at
the very moment he was going to be hanged&mdash;at that moment of all
others in which any of us would desire to be left to his own reflections&mdash;appeared
at the time to be hard indeed. After passing
under the great gate and subterraneous exit called Porta Reale,
the procession wound its way across the drawbridges, and along
the deep ditches, &amp;c., of the fortification, until coming out upon the
great esplanade which lies between Valetta and Floriana, an immense
crowd of people was suddenly seen waiting round the gallows&mdash;at
the sight of which I pulled up. The priests were now
more eager than ever in beseeching the criminal to call upon the
name of their saint;&mdash;the mutes, whose white robes in all directions
were seen scattered among the people, were evidently shaking
their boxes more violently than ever, while among the crowd there
was a general lifting of feet, which showed the intense anxiety of
their feelings.</p>

<p>As the procession slowly approached the gallows, I could not
hear what was going on; but in a very short time, from the distance
at which I stood, I saw the man led up the ladder by the executioner,
who continued always a step or two above him: the rope
was round his neck, and resting loosely on the culprit&rsquo;s head, there
was something like a round wooden plate, through a hole in the
centre of which the rope passed. As soon as the poor creature
got high up on the ladder, the vociferations of the priests suddenly
ceased; for a few seconds a dead silence ensued, when all of a sudden,
there was a simultaneous burst or shriek of exclamation from
priests and populace, echoing and re-echoing the words &ldquo;Viva la
Cristianità!&rdquo; which the man, in a low tone of voice, had just been
persuaded to utter. All caps waved&mdash;every human being seemed
congratulating each other on the delightful conversion; and no
person seemed to pay the slightest possible attention to the poor
wretch, who, with the last syllable on his lips, had been pushed
off the ladder, and was now calmly swinging in the air, the executioner
standing on the loose wooden plate above his head, holding
by the rope, and, with many antics, stamping with all his force to
break the neck, while the people, in groups, were already bending
their steps homewards. Not wishing to encounter such a crowd,
I turned my horse in another direction, and passed a number of
mules and asses belonging to many of the people who had come
from the most remote casals to see the execution. The animals
were all standing half asleep, nodding their heads in the sun&mdash;a
herd of goats were as quietly grazing near the ramparts; and when
I contrasted the tranquillity which these animals were enjoying, with
the scene I had just witnessed, I could not help feeling that I had
more cause than Virgil to exclaim&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Sic vos non vobis!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>In returning from my ride I had to cross the esplanade, and as
there was then no one at the gallows, I rode close by it. The
figure, which was still hanging, was turning round very slowly, as
if it were roasting before the sun; the neck was so completely disjointed
that the head almost hung downwards, and as I rode by it I
was much struck in observing that the tongue was out of the mouth
half bitten off&mdash;a dreadful emblem, thought I, of a renegade to his
religion! Whether or not the poor wretch had been induced to
utter his last exclamation, from a hollow promise that it would save
his life, is a mystery which will probably never on this earth be
explained to us; however, whatever was his creed, it is impossible
to deny that when he swung from this world to eternity, he had but
little reason to admire the practical part of a Roman Catholic&rsquo;s
mercy, however unanswerably its theory might have been explained
to him.</p>

<p>As soon as I got to Valetta, I put up my horse, and, strolling
about the streets, soon found myself in the immense church of St.
John, which, in point of size and magnificence, is only second in
the world to St. Peter&rsquo;s, at Rome. The congregation was almost
exclusively composed of the people who had attended the execution,
and quantities of men, as well as women, shrouded in their
black silk faldettes, were listening to a tall, strong-looking Capuchin
friar, who, with great emphasis, was preaching from a high pulpit,
placed at a projecting angle of one of the many chapels which
ramified from the aisle or great body of the church. He was a
remarkably handsome man, of about thirty, and though his face
was pale, or rather brown, yet his eye and features were strikingly
vivid and intellectual; a rim or band of jet-black hair encircled his
head, the rest of his hair by a double tonsure having been shaved
at the top and from ear to ear; his throat was completely uncovered,
and as he suddenly turned from one part of his congregation
to another, his earnest attitudes were very beautiful. His brown
sackcloth cowl hung in folds over his shoulders, and the loose
negligent manner in which a cloak of the same coarse material
hung upon his body, being apparently merely kept together by the
white rope, or whip of knots, which encircled his waist, displayed a
series of lines which any painter might well have copied; indeed,
the whole dress of the Capuchins has been admirably well
imagined, and above all others is it calculated to impress upon the
mind of the spectator that its wearer is a man doomed to abstinence
and mortification, seeking no enjoyment on this side of the grave,
and never lowering his eyes from heaven, but fervently to exclaim&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot center">
&ldquo;Vain pomp and glory of the world, I hate ye!&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>The subject of the sermon was, of course, the execution which we
had all witnessed. The hard-hearted infidelity of the Turks was
very richly painted and described, and the crime which they had just
seen expiated was clearly proved to be the effect, and the natural
effect, of a Mahometan&rsquo;s anger. The happy conversion of the infidel
then became a subject which was listened to with the most
remarkable stillness, and every eye was riveted upon the mouth of
the Capuchin, as he minutely detailed the triumph and the conquest
which had been made of the sheep which had that day, before their
eyes, been added to the flock. He then explained, or endeavoured
to explain (for it was no very easy task), that the money which had
that morning been collected for the purchase of masses proved to
be just sufficient to purify the soul of the departed sinner; but this,
he very eloquently demonstrated, was only to be effected through
the mediation of one whose image nailed to the cross was actually
erected in the pulpit on his right hand. After expatiating on this
subject at considerable length, working himself and his hearers into
a state of very great excitement, with both his arms stretched out,
with his eyes uplifted, he most fervently addressed the figure, exclaiming
in a most emphatic tone of voice&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Si! mio caro Signore!
Si!</i>&rdquo; &amp;c. The effect which was instantly produced in the hearts
of his hearers was very evident, and the fine melodious voice,
together with the strong, nervous, muscular attitude of the preacher,
contrasted with the drooping, exhausted, lifeless image above him,
would have worked its effect upon the mind of any Christian
spectator.</p>

<p>As soon as the sermon was over, the congregation dispersed.
The day ended in universal joy and festivity; no revengeful recollections&mdash;no
unkind feelings were entertained towards him who had
been the principal actor of that day; on the contrary, the Maltese
seemed rather to feel, that it was to him they were especially indebted
for the pleasurable performances they had witnessed, and
thus&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot center">
&ldquo;In peaceful merriment ran down the sun&rsquo;s declining ray.&rdquo;<br />

<h2><a name="SCHLANGENBAD_OR_THE_SERPENTS_BATH" id="SCHLANGENBAD_OR_THE_SERPENTS_BATH">SCHLANGENBAD; OR, THE SERPENTS&rsquo; BATH.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Time</span> had glided along so agreeably ever since my arrival at
Langen-Schwalbach, my body had enjoyed such perpetual motion,
my mind such absolute rest, that I had almost forgotten, though my
holiday was nearly over, I had not yet reached the intended <i>nec
plus ultra</i> of my travels&mdash;namely, Schlangenbad, or the Serpents'
Bath. On the spur of the moment, therefore, I ordered a carriage;
and, with my wallet lying by my side, having bidden adieu to
a simple-hearted village, which, for the short remainder of my days,
I believe, I shall remember with regard, I continued for some time
gradually to ascend its eastern boundary, until I arrived nearly at
the summit or pinnacle of the Taunus hills. The view from this
point was very extensive indeed, and the park-like appearance of
the whole of the lofty region or upper story of Nassau formed a
prospect at once noble and pleasing. The Langen-Schwalbach
band of wind-instruments was playing deep beneath me in the
valley, but hidden by the fog, its sound was so driven about by the
wind, that had I not recognized the tunes I but faintly heard,
I should not have been able to determine from what point of the
compass they proceeded. Sometimes they seemed to rise, like the
mist, from one valley&mdash;sometimes from another&mdash;occasionally I
fancied they were like the hurricane, sweeping across the surface of
the country, and once I could almost have declared that the Æolian
band was calmly seated above me in the air.</p>

<p>The numberless ravines which intersect Nassau were not discernible
from the spot where my carriage had halted, and Langen-Schwalbach
was so muffled in its peaceful retreat, that a stranger
could scarcely have guessed it existed.</p>

<p>From this elevated point the Taunus hills began gradually to fall
towards Wiesbaden and Frankfort; but a branch road, suddenly
turning to the right, rapidly descended, or rather meandered down
a long, rocky, narrow ravine, clothed with beech and oak-trees to
its summit.</p>

<p>With a wheel of the carriage dragged, as I glided fast down this
romantic valley, the scenery, compared with what I had just left,
was on a very confined, contracted scale&mdash;in short, nothing was to
be seen but a trickling stream running down the grassy bottom of
a valley, and hills which appeared to environ it on both sides; besides
this, the road writhed and bent so continually, that I could seldom
see a quarter of a mile of it at once.</p>

<p>After descending about three-quarters of a league, I came to a
new turn, and here <em class="smcap">Schlangenbad</em>, the <em class="smcap">Serpents&rsquo; Bath</em>, dressed in
its magic mantle of tranquillity, suddenly appeared not only before,
but within less than a hundred yards of me.</p>

<p>This secluded spot, to which such a number of people annually
retreat, consists of nothing but an immense old building, or &ldquo;Bad-Haus,&rdquo;
a new one, with two or three little mills, which, fed, as it
were, by the crumbs that fall from the rich man&rsquo;s table, are turned
by the famous spring of water, after fine, fashionable ladies have
done washing themselves in it.</p>

<p>When the carriage stopped, my first impression (which but too
often, I regret to say, has been an erroneous one) was not in favour
of the place; for, though its colours were certainly very beautiful,
yet, from being so completely surrounded by hills, it seemed to wear
some of the features of a prison; and when, my vehicle driving
away, I was first left by myself, I felt for a moment that the little
band of music, which was playing upon the terrace above my head,
was not quite competent to enliven the scene. However, after I
had walked in various directions about this sequestered spot, sufficiently
not only to become acquainted with its <i>locale</i>, but to discover
that it possessed a number of modest beauties, completely veiled
from the passing gaze of the stranger, I went to the old &ldquo;Bad-Haus,&rdquo;
to obtain rooms from the bath-master (appointed by the Duke),
who has charge of both these great establishments.</p>

<p>I found the little man seated in his office, in the agony of calculating
upon a slate the amount of seven times nine; perceiving,
however, that instead of multiplying the two figures together, he
had reared up a ladder of seven nines, which he was slowly ascending,
step by step, I felt quite unwilling to interrupt him; and
as his wife appeared to be gifted with all or many of the little abilities
in which he might have been deficient, I gladly availed myself of
her offer to show me over the two buildings, in order that I might
select some apartments.</p>

<p>The old &ldquo;Bad-Haus,&rdquo; and Hotel de Nassau, which, being united
together, form one of the two great buildings I have mentioned,
are situated on the side of the hill close to the macadamized road
which leads to Mainz; and to give some idea of the gigantic scale
on which these sorts of German bathing establishments are constructed,
I will state, that in this rambling &ldquo;Bad-Haus&rdquo; I counted
443 windows, and that, without ever twice going over the same
ground, I found the passages measured 409 paces, or, as nearly as
possible, a quarter of a mile!</p>

<p>Below this immense barrack, and on the opposite side of the road,
is the new &ldquo;Bad-Haus,&rdquo; or bathing house, pleasantly situated in a
shrubbery. This building (which contains 172 windows) is of a
modern construction, and straddling across the bottom of the valley,
the celebrated water, which rises milk-warm from the rock, after
supplying the baths on the lower story, runs from beneath it. No
sooner, however, does the fluid escape from the building, than a
group of poor washerwomen, standing up to their knees on a sheet,
which is stretched upon the ground, humbly make use of it before
it has time to get to the two little mills which are patiently waiting
for it about a couple of hundred yards below.</p>

<p>After having passed, in the two establishments, an immense
number of rooms, each furnished by the Duke with white window-curtains,
a walnut-tree bed with bedding; a chestnut-tree table, an
elastic spring sofa, and three or four walnut-tree chairs, the price
of each room (on an average from 10<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> a-day) being painted
on the door, I complimented the good, or, to give her her proper
title, the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; lady who attended me, on the plain, but useful order
in which they appeared; in return for which she very obligingly
offered to show me the source of the famous water, for the sake of
which two such enormous establishments had been erected.</p>

<p>In the history of the little duchy of Nassau, the discovery of this
spring forms a story full of innocence and simplicity. Once upon a
time there was a heifer, with which everything in nature seemed to
disagree. The more she ate, the thinner she grew&mdash;the more
her mother licked her hide, the rougher and the more staring
was her coat. Not a fly in the forest would bite her&mdash;never was
she seen to chew the cud, but hide-bound, and melancholy, her
hips seemed actually to be protruding from her skin. What was
the matter with her no one knew&mdash;what could cure her no one
could divine;&mdash;in short, deserted by her master and her species, she
was, as the faculty would term it, &ldquo;given over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a few weeks, however, she suddenly re-appeared among the
herd, with ribs covered with flesh&mdash;eyes like a deer&mdash;skin sleek as
a mole&rsquo;s&mdash;breath sweetly smelling of milk&mdash;saliva hanging in ringlets
from her jaw! Every day seemed to re-establish her health;
and the phenomenon was so striking, that the herdsman, feeling
induced to watch her, discovered that regularly every evening she
wormed her way, in secret, into the forest, until she reached an
unknown spring of water, from which, having refreshed herself,
she quietly returned to the valley.</p>

<p>The trifling circumstance, scarcely known, was almost forgotten
by the peasant, when a young Nassau lady began decidedly to show
exactly the same incomprehensible symptoms as the heifer. Mother,
sisters, friends, father, all tried to cure her, but in vain; and the
physician had actually</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Taken his leave with sighs and sorrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Despairing of his fee to-morrow,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>when the herdsman, happening to hear of her case, prevailed upon
her, at last, to try the heifer&rsquo;s secret remedy&mdash;she did so; and, in
a very short time, to the utter astonishment of her friends, she
became one of the stoutest and roundest young women in the
duchy.</p>

<p>What had suddenly cured one sick lady was soon deemed a proper
prescription for others, and all cases meeting with success, the
spring, gradually rising into notice, received its name from a circumstance
which I shall shortly explain. In the meanwhile, I will
observe, that even to this day horses are brought by the peasants
to be bathed, and I have good authority for believing, that in cases
of slight consumption of the lungs (a disorder common enough
among horses), the animal recovers his flesh with surprising rapidity&mdash;nay,
I have seen even the pigs bathed, though I must own
that <i>they</i> appeared to have no other disorder except hunger. But
to return to the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; lady.</p>

<p>After following her through a labyrinth of passages (one of which
not only leant sideways, but had an ascent like a hill), she at last
unlocked a door, which was no sooner opened, than I saw glide
along the floor close by me a couple of small serpents! As the lady
was talking very earnestly at the time, I merely flinched aside as
they passed, without making any observation; but after I had crossed
a small garden, she pointed to a door which she said was that of
the source, and while she stopped to speak to one of the servants,
I advanced alone, and opening the gate, saw beneath me a sort of
brunnen with three serpents about the size of vipers swimming
about in it! Unable to contain my surprise, I made a signal to the
lady with my staff, and as she hurried towards me, I still pointed to
the reptiles, as if to know why in the name of Æsculapius they
were allowed thus to contaminate the source of the baths?</p>

<p>In the calmest manner possible, my conductress (who seemed
perfectly to comprehend my sensations) replied, &ldquo;<i>Au contraire,
c'est ce qui donne qualité à ces eaux!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The quantity of these reptiles, or Schlangen, that exist in the
woods surrounding the spring is very great; and they of course
have given their name to the place. When full grown they are
about five feet long, and in hot weather are constantly seen gliding
across the paths, or rustling under the dead leaves of the
forest.</p>

<p>As soon as the lady had shown me the whole establishment, she
strongly recommended me to take up my abode in the old &ldquo;Bad-Haus;&rdquo;
however, on my first arrival, in crossing the promenade in
front of it, I had caught a glimpse of some talkative old ladies,
whose tongues and knitting needles seemed to be racing against
each other, which made it very advisable to decline the polite invitation;
and I accordingly selected apartments at one extremity of
the new Bad-Haus, my windows on the north looking into the
shrubbery, those on the east upon the two little water-mills, revolving
in the green lonely valley of Schlangenbad.</p>

<p>The cell of the hermit can hardly be more peaceful than this
abode: it is true it was not only completely inhabited (there
being no more rooms unoccupied), but it was teeming with people
many of whom are known in the great world. For instance, among
its inmates were the Princess Romanow, first wife of the late
Grand Duke Constantine of Russia&mdash;the Duke of Saxe-Coburg&mdash;the
Prince of Hesse Homburg (whose brother, the late Landgrave,
married the Princess Elizabeth of England)&mdash;a Prussian Minister
from Berlin, and occasionally the Princess Royal of Prussia, married
to the son of King Frederic William. No part of the building
was exclusively occupied by these royal guests, but paying for their
rooms no more than the prices marked upon the doors, they ascended
the same staircase and walked along the same passages
with the humblest inmates of the place. Yet within the narrow
dominion of their own chamber, visiters were received with every
attention due to form and etiquette. The silence and apparent
solitude which reigned, however, in this new &ldquo;Bad-Haus&rdquo; was to
me always a subject of astonishment and admiration. Sometimes a
person would be seen carefully locking his door, and then, with the
key in his pocket, quietly stealing along the passage: at other times,
a lady might be caught on tip-toes softly ascending the stairs; but
neither steps nor voices were to be heard; and far from witnessing
anything like ostentation, it seemed to me that concealment
was rather the order of the day. As soon as it grew dark, a single
wick floating in a small glass lamp, open at the top, was placed at
each great entrance door; and another at each extremity of the
long passages into which the rooms on each floor communicated,
giving the visiters just light enough to avoid running against the
walls: in obscure weather, there was also a lamp here and there
in the shrubbery, but as long as the pale moon shone in the
heavens, its lovely light was deemed sufficient.</p>

<p>A table d'hôte dinner, at a florin for each person, was daily prepared,
for all, or any, who might choose to attend it; and for
about the same price, a dinner with knives, forks, table-cloth,
napkins, &amp;c., would be forwarded to any guest who, like myself, was
fond of the luxury of solitude: coffee and tea were cheap in proportion.</p>

<p>I have dwelt long upon these apparently trifling details, because,
humble as they may sound, I conceive that they contain a very important
moral. How many of our country people are always raving
about the cheapness of the Continent, and how many every year
break up their establishments in England to go in search of it;
yet, if we had but sense, or rather courage enough to live at
home as economically and as rationally as princes and people of
all ranks live throughout the rest of Europe, how unnecessary
would be the sacrifice, and how much real happiness would be the
result!</p>

<p>The baths at Schlangenbad are the most harmless and delicious
luxuries of the sort I have ever enjoyed; and I really quite looked
forward to the morning for the pleasure with which I paid my addresses
to this delightful element. The effect the water produces
on the skin is very singular; it is about as warm as milk, but infinitely
softer: and after dipping the hand into it, if the thumb be rubbed
against the fingers, it is said by many to resemble satin. Nevertheless,
whatever may be its sensation, when the reader reflects
that people not only come to these baths from Russia, but that
the water in stone bottles, merely as a cosmetic, is sent to St. Petersburg
and other distant parts of Europe, he will admit that it must
be soft indeed to have gained for itself such an extraordinary degree
of celebrity: for there is no town at Schlangenbad, not even a
village&mdash;nothing therefore but the real or fancied charm of the
water could attract people into a little sequestered valley, which
in every sense of the word is out of sight of the civilized world;
and yet I must say, that I never remember to have existed in a
place which possessed such fascinating beauties; besides which
(to say nothing of breathing pure, dry air), it is no small pleasure
to live in a skin which puts all people in good humour&mdash;at least,
with themselves. But besides the cosmetic charms of this water,
it is declared to possess virtues of more substantial value: it is said
to tranquillize the nerves, to soothe all inflammation; and from
this latter property; the cures of consumption which are reported
to have been effected, among human beings and cattle, may have
proceeded. Yet whatever <i>good</i> effect the water may have upon
this insidious disorder, its first operation most certainly must be to
neutralize the <i>bad</i> effect of the climate, which to consumptive patients
must decidedly be a very severe trial, for delightful as it is to
people in robust health, yet the keenness of the mountain air, together
with the sudden alternations of temperature to which the
valley of Schlangenbad is exposed, must, I think, be anything but
a remedy for weak lungs.</p>

<p>The effect produced upon the skin, by lying about twenty minutes
in the bath, I one day, happened to overhear a short, fat Frenchman
describe to his friend in the following words&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Monsieur, dans
ces bains on devient absolument amoureux de soi-même!</i>&rdquo; I cannot
exactly corroborate this Gallic statement, yet I must admit that
limbs, even old ones, gradually do appear as if they were converted
into white marble. The skin assumes a sort of glittering, phosphoric
brightness, resembling very much white objects, which,
having been thrown overboard, in calm weather within the tropics,
many of my readers have probably watched sinking in the ocean,
which seems to blanch and illuminate them as they descend. The
effect is very extraordinary, and I know not how to account for it,
unless it be produced by some prismatic refraction, caused by the
peculiar particles with which the fluid is impregnated.</p>

<p>The Schlangenbad water contains the muriates and carbonates of
lime, soda, and magnesia, with a slight excess of carbonic acid
which holds the carbonates in solution. The celebrated embellishment
which it produces on the skin is, in my opinion, a sort of
corrosion, which removes tan, or any other artificial covering that
the surface may have attained from exposure and ill-treatment by
the sun and wind. In short the body is cleaned by it, just as a
kitchen-maid scours her copper saucepan; and the effect being
evident, ladies modestly approach it from the most distant parts of
Europe. I am by no means certain, however, that they receive
any permanent benefit; indeed, on the contrary, I should think that
their skins would eventually become, if anything, coarser, from the
removal of a slight veil or covering, intended by Nature as a protection
to the cuticle.</p>

<p>But whether this water be permanently beneficial to ladies or
not, the softness it gives to the whole body is quite delightful; and
with two elements, air and water, in perfection, I found that I grew
every hour more and more attached to the place.</p>

<p>On the cellar-floor, or lower story of my abode (&ldquo;the New
Bad-Haus&rdquo;), where the baths are situated, there lived an old man
and his wife, whose duty it was to prepare the baths, and to give
towels, &amp;c. I do not know whether the Schlangenbad waters corrode
the temper as well as the skin, yet, certainly, this old couple
appeared to me to be continually quarrelling; and every little trifle
I required for my bath, though given to me with the greatest good-will,
seemed to form a subject of jealous dispute between this subterranean
pair. The old woman, however, invariably got the best
of the argument,&mdash;a triumph which I suspect proceeded more from
her physical than moral powers: in short, as is occasionally the
case, the old gentleman was afraid of his companion; and I observed
that his attitude, as he argued, very much resembled that of a cat
in a corner, when spitting in the face of a terrier dog. Finding
that they did not work happily together, I always managed to prevent
both of them coming to me at once. The old woman, however,
insisted on preparing my bath; and, with a great pole in one
hand, stirring up the water&mdash;a thermometer in the other, and a
pair of spectacles blinded with steam on her nose, she very good-naturedly
brought the temperature of the water to the proper degree,
which is said to be 27 of Reaumur.</p>

<p>After I had had my bath, the old wife being out of the way, I
one day paid a visit of compliment to her husband, who had shown,
by many little attempted attentions, that he was, had he dared, as
anxious as his partner to serve me. With great delight, he showed
me several bottles full of serpents; and then, opening a wooden
box, he took out, as a fisherwoman would handle eels, some very
long ones&mdash;one of which (first looking over his shoulder to see
that a certain personage was away) he put upon a line, which she
had stretched across the room for drying clothes. In order, I
suppose, to demonstrate to me that the reptile was harmless, he
took it off the rope, along which it was moving very quickly; and,
without submitting his project for my approbation, he suddenly
placed it on my breast, along which it crawled, until, stretching its
long neck with half its body into the air, it held on, in a most singular
manner, by a single fold in the cloth, which, by a sort of
contortion of the vertebræ, it firmly grasped.</p>

<p>The old man, apparently highly satisfied with this first act of
his entertainment, gravely proceeded to show living serpents of
all colours and sizes,&mdash;stuffed serpents, and serpents&rsquo; skins,&mdash;all of
which seemed very proper hobbies, to amuse the long winter evenings
of the aged servant of Schlangenbad, or the Serpents&rsquo; Bath.</p>

<p>At last, however, the fellow&rsquo;s dry, blanched, wrinkled face began
to smile. Grinning, as he slowly mounted on a chair, he took from
a high shelf a broad-mouthed, white glass bottle, and then, in a
sort of savage ecstasy, pronouncing the word &ldquo;<em class="smcap">Baromet</em>!&rdquo; he placed
it in my hands.</p>

<p>The bottle was about half full of dirty water&mdash;a few dead flies
and crumbs of bread were at the bottom&mdash;and near the top there
was a small piece of thin wood which went about half across the
phial. Upon this slender scaffolding, its fishy eyes staring upwards
at a piece of coarse linen, which, being tied round the mouth,
served as a cork&mdash;the shrivelled skin of its under-jaw moving at
every sweltering breath which it took&mdash;there sat a large, speckled,
living toad!</p>

<p>Like Sterne&rsquo;s captive, he had not by his side &ldquo;a bundle of sticks,
notched with all the dismal days and nights he had passed there;&rdquo;
yet their sum total was as clearly expressed in the unhealthy colour
of the poor creature&rsquo;s skin; and certainly, in my lifetime, I never
had seen what might truly be called&mdash;a sick toad.</p>

<p>It was quite impossible to help pitying any living being, confined
by itself in so miserable a dungeon. However, the old man&rsquo;s
eyes were beaming with pride and delight at what he conceived to
be his own ingenuity&mdash;and exclaiming &ldquo;Schönes Wetter!&rdquo; (fine
weather!) he pointed to the wood-work on which the poor creature
was sitting&mdash;and then he exultingly explained that, so soon
as it should be going to rain, the toad would get down into the
water. &ldquo;<em class="smcap">Baromet!</em>&rdquo; repeated the old fellow, grinning from ear to
ear, as, mounting on the chair, he replaced his prisoner on the
shelf.</p>

<p>My first impression was, &ldquo;<i>coûte qui coûte</i>,&rdquo; to buy this barometer,&mdash;carry
its poor captive to the largest marsh I could find,&mdash;and
then, breaking the bottle into shivers, to give him, what toads
appreciate better than mankind&mdash;liberty; but, on reflecting a moment,
I felt quite sure that the old inquisitor would soon procure
another subject for torture; and, as with toads as with ourselves,
&ldquo;<i>c'est le premier pas qui coûte</i>,&rdquo; I thought it better that this poor
imprisoned creature, to a certain degree accustomed to his misery,
should exist in it, than that a fresh toad should suffer:&mdash;it also occurred
to me, that if I should dare to purchase his rude instrument,
the ingenious, unfeeling old wretch of a philosopher might be encouraged
to make others for sale.</p>

<p>The old bath, or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; man, had vipers&rsquo; nests, their eggs, and
many other Caliban curiosities, which he was desirous to show me;
but having seen quite enough for one morning&rsquo;s visit, and besides,
hearing his wife&rsquo;s tongue coming along the subterranean passage, I
left him&mdash;her&mdash;toad&mdash;reptiles, &amp;c., to fret away their existence,
while I rose into far brighter regions above them.</p>

<p>After ascending a couple of flights of stairs, I strolled for some
time on the little parade, which is close to the entrance of the old
&ldquo;Bad-Haus;&rdquo; but the benches being all occupied by people listening
to the band of music, and besides, not liking the artificial passages
of hedges cut, without metaphor, to the quick, I bade adieu to the
scene; and, entering the great forest, with which the hills in every
direction were clothed to their summits, I ascended a steep, broad
road (across which a couple of schlangens glided close by me), until
I came to a hut, from which there is a very pleasing home view
of the little valley of Schlangenbad. It is certainly a most romantic
spot, and that it had appeared so to others was evident, from a
marble pillar and inscription which stood on the edge of a precipice
before me. The tale it commemorated is simply beautiful. The
Count de Grunne, the Dutch Ambassador at Frankfort, having, in
the healthy autumn of his life, come to Schlangenbad, with his
young wife, was so enchanted with the loveliness of the country,
the mildness of the air, and the exquisite softness of the water, that,
quite unable to contain himself, on a black marble column he caused
to be sculptured, as emblems of himself and his companion, two
crested schlangens, eating leaves (apparently a salad) out of the
same bowl&mdash;with the following pathetic inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">

</p>

<p>Leaving this quiet sentimental bower, and descending the hill, I
entered the great pile of buildings of the old Bad-Haus, or Nassauer-Hof,
and as I was advancing along one of its endless passages,
I passed an open door, from which a busy hum proceeded
which clearly proclaimed it to be a school. My grave Mentor-like
figure was no sooner observed silently standing at its portal, than
its master, a short, slight, hectic-looking lad, scarcely twenty,
seemed to feel an unaccountable desire to form my acquaintance.
Begging me to enter his small literary dominion, he very modestly
requested leave to be permitted to explain to me the nature of the
studies he was imparting to his subjects; the little creatures, from
their benches, looking at me all the time with the same sort of fear
with which mice look into the face of a bull-dog, or frogs at the
terrific bill and outline of a stork.</p>

<p>Having, by a slight inclination, accepted this offer, the young
Dominie commenced by stating that all the children in Nassau are
<i>obliged</i>, by order of the Duke, to go to school, from six to fourteen
years of age;&mdash;that the parents of a child, who has intentionally
missed, are forced to pay two kreuzers the first time, four the
second, six the third, and that if they are too poor to pay these
fines, they are obliged to work them out in hard labour, or are
otherwise punished for their children&rsquo;s neglect;&mdash;that the inhabitants
of each village pay the schoolmaster among themselves, in
proportions, varying according to their means, but that the Duke
prescribes what the children are to learn&mdash;namely, religion, singing,
reading, writing, Scripture history, the German language,
natural history, geography, and accounts;&mdash;and that the mode of
imparting this education is grounded upon the system of Pestalozzi.</p>

<p>This introductory explanation being concluded, the young master
now displayed to me specimens of his scholars&rsquo; writing&mdash;showed
me their slates covered with sums in the first rules of arithmetic&mdash;and
then calling up several girls and boys, he placed his wand in
the hand of each trembling little urchin, who one by one was
desired to point out upon maps, which hung against the walls, the
great oceans, seas, mountains, and capitals of our globe. Having
expressed my unqualified approbation of the zeal and attention with
which this excellent young man had evidently been labouring, at
the arduous, &ldquo;never-ending, still beginning&rdquo; duties of his life, I was
about to depart, when, as a last favour, he anxiously intreated me
to hear his children, for one moment, sing; and striking the table
with his wand, it instantly, as if it had been a tuning fork, called
them to attention&mdash;at a second blow on the table, they pushed aside
their slates and books&mdash;at a third, opening their eyes as wide as
they could, they inflated their tiny lungs brimfull&mdash;and at a
fourth blow, in full cry, they all opened, to my no small astonishment,
mouths which, in blackness of inside, exactly resembled a
pack of King Charles&rsquo;s spaniels: had the children been drinking
ink, their tongues and palates could not have been darker; and
though, accompanied by their master, the psalm they were singing
was simply beautiful, and though their infantine voices streaming
along the endless passages produced a reverberation which was exceedingly
pleasing, yet there was something so irresistibly comic in
their appearance, that any countenance but my own would have
smiled.</p>

<p>The cause of the odd-looking phenomenon suddenly occurred to
me,&mdash;having, in the morning, observed several peasants, whose
trowsers at the knees were stained perfectly black, by their having
knelt down to pick bilberries, which grow on the forest-covered
hills of Nassau in the greatest profusion. The children had evidently
been grazing on the same ground, and as soon as the idea
occurred, I observed by their little black fingers that my solution of
the dark problem was correct.</p>

<p>Returning to my residence, the New Bad-Haus, the sun, though
much less weary than myself, having sunk to rest, I sat alone for
some time in one of the bowers of the shrubbery belonging to the
building. Occasionally a human figure, scarcely visible from the
deep shade of the trees, glided slowly by me, but whether that of a
prince or a peasant I neither knew nor cared. What interested me
infinitely more, was to observe the fire-flies, which, with small lanterns
in their tails, were either soaring close above me, or sparkling
among the bushes. The bright emerald green light which they possessed
was lovely beyond description, yet apparently they had only
received permission to display it so long as they remained on the
wing&mdash;and as two young ones, gliding before me, rested for a moment
on a rose-leaf, at my side, the instant they closed their wings,
they were left together in total darkness. Some (probably old
ones) steadily sailing, passed me, as if on business, while others,
dancing in the air, had evidently no object except pleasure; yet,
whether flying in a circle or in a line, each little creature, as it proceeded,
gaily illuminated its own way, and like a pure, cheerful,
well-conditioned mind, it also shed a trifling lustre on whatever it
approached.</p>

<p>As I sat here alone in the dark, I could not drive from my mind
the interesting picture I had just been witnessing in the little village

<p>We are all in England so devotedly attached to that odd, easily
pronounced, but difficult to be defined word&mdash;liberty, that there is,
perhaps, nothing we should all at once set our backs, our faces, and
our heads against more, than a national compulsatory system of
education, similar to that prescribed in Nassau; and yet, if law has
the power to punish crime, there seems at first to exist no very
strong reason why it should not also be permitted, by education, to
prevent it. Every respectable parent in our country will be ready
to admit, that the most certain recipe for making his son a useful, a
happy, and a valuable member of society, is carefully to attend to
the cultivation of his mind. We all believe that good seeds can be
sown there, that bad ones can be eradicated&mdash;that ignorance leads
a child to error and crime&mdash;that his mental darkness, like a town,
can be illuminated&mdash;that the judgment (his only weapon against his
passions) can, like the blacksmith&rsquo;s arm, by use, be strengthened;
and if it be thus universally admitted that education is one of the
most valuable properties a rational being can bequeath to his own
child, it would seem to follow that a parental government might
claim (at least before Heaven) nearly as much right to sentence a
child to education, as a criminal to the gallows. Nevertheless, as a
curious example of the difference in national taste, it may be observed,
that though in England judges and juries can anywhere be
found to condemn the body, they would everywhere be observed to
shrink at the very idea of chastening the mind; they see no moral
or religious objection to imprison the former, but they all agree that
it would be a political offence to liberate the latter. Although our
poor-laws oblige every parish to feed, house, and clothe its offspring,
yet in England it is thought wrong to enforce any national
provision for the mind, and yet the Duke of Nassau might argue,
that in a civilized community children have no more natural <i>right</i>
to be brought up ignorant than naked; in short, that if the mildest
government be justified in forcing a man, for decency&rsquo;s sake, to envelop
his body, it might equally claim the power of obliging him,
for the welfare, prosperity, and advancement of the community&mdash;to
develop his mind.</p>

<p>Into so complicated an argument I feel myself quite incompetent
to enter; yet were I at this moment to be leaving this world, there
is no one assertion I think I could more solemnly maintain&mdash;there
is no important fact I am more seriously convinced of&mdash;and there
is no evidence which, from the observation of my whole life,
I could more conscientiously deliver, than that, as far as I have been
capable of judging, our system of education in England has produced,
does produce, and so long as it be persisted in, must produce,
the most lamentable political effects.</p>

<p>Strange as it may sound, I believe few people will, on reflection,
deny, what a most remarkable difference exists between a man and
what is termed mankind&mdash;in fact, between the intelligence of the
human being and that of the species to which he belongs.</p>

<p>If a man of common or of the commonest abilities be watched
throughout a day, it is quite delightful to remark how cleverly he
adapts his conduct to the various trifling unforeseen circumstances
which occur&mdash;how shrewdly, as through a labyrinth, he pursues
his own interests, and with what alacrity he can alter his plans, or,
as it is vulgarly termed, change his mind, the instant it becomes
advisable for him to do so. Appeal to him on any plain subject, and
you find him gifted with quick perception, possessed with ready
judgment, and with his mind sparkling with intelligence. Now, mix
a dozen such men together, and intellect instantly begins to
coagulate; in short, by addition you have produced subtraction.
One man means what he cannot clearly explain&mdash;another ably
expresses what he did not exactly mean&mdash;one, while disputing his
neighbour&rsquo;s judgment, neglects his own&mdash;another indolently reclines
his head upon his neighbour&rsquo;s brain&mdash;one does not care to
see&mdash;another forgets to foresee&mdash;in short, though any one pilot
could steer the vessel into port, with twelve at the helm she
inevitably runs upon the rocks. Now, instead of a dozen men, if
anything be committed to the care, judgment, or honour of a large
body, or, as it is not improperly termed, a &ldquo;corporation&rdquo; of men,
their torpor, apathy, and sloth are infinitely increased, and when,
instead of a corporation, it be left to that nonentity, a whole nation&mdash;the
total neglect it meets with is beyond all remedy. In short,
the individuals of a community, compared with the community
itself, are like a swarm of bees compared with bees that have
swarmed or clung together in a lump; and as the countryman stands
shaking the dull mass from the bough, one can scarcely believe
that it is composed of little, active, intelligent, busy creatures, each
armed with a sting as well as with knowledge, and arrangements
which one can hardly sufficiently admire. If this theory be correct,
it will account at once for our unfortunate system of education in
England, which, being everybody&rsquo;s duty, is therefore nobody&rsquo;s duty,
and which, like</p>

<span class="i0">&ldquo;The child whom many fathers share,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Has never known a father&rsquo;s care.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In the evening of a long, toilsome life, if a man were to be
obliged solemnly to declare what, without any exception, has been
the most lovely thing which on the surface of this earth it has been
his good fortune to witness, I conceive that, without hesitation, he
might reply&mdash;<i>The mind of a young child</i>. Indeed, if we believe
that creation, with all its charms, was beneficently made for
man, it seems almost to follow that his mind, that mirror in which
every minute object is to be reflected, must be gifted with a polish
sufficiently high to enable it to receive the lovely and delicate
images created for its enjoyment. Accordingly, we observe with
what delight a child beholds light&mdash;colours&mdash;flowers&mdash;fruit, and
every new object that meets his eye; and we all know that before
his judgment be permitted to interfere, for many years he feels, or
rather suffers, a thirst for information which is almost insatiable.</p>

<p>He desires, and very naturally desires, to know what the moon
is?&mdash;what are the stars?&mdash;where the rain, wind, and storm come
from? With innocent simplicity he asks, what becomes of the
light of a candle when it is blown out? Any story or any history
he greedily devours; and so strongly does his youthful mind retain
every sort of image impressed upon it, that it is well known his after
life is often incapable of obliterating the terror depicted there by
an old nurse&rsquo;s tales of ghosts, and hobgoblins of darkness.</p>

<p>Now with their minds in this pure, healthy, voracious state, the
sons of all our noblest families, and of the most estimable people
in the country, are, after certain preparations, eventually sent to
those slaughter-houses of the understanding, our public schools,
where, weaned from the charms of the living world, they are
nailed to the study of two dead languages&mdash;like galley-slaves, they
are chained to these oars, and are actually flogged if they neglect
to labour. Instead of imbibing knowledge suited to their youthful
age, they are made to learn the names of Actæon&rsquo;s hounds&mdash;to
study the life of Alexander&rsquo;s horse&mdash;to know the fate of Alcibiades&rsquo;s
dog;&mdash;in short, it is too well known that Dr. Lempriere made
3000<i>l.</i> a-year by the sale of a dictionary, in which he had amassed,
&ldquo;for the use of schools,&rdquo; tales and rubbish of this description.
The poor boy at last &ldquo;gets,&rdquo; as it is termed, &ldquo;into Ovid,&rdquo; where
he is made to study everything which human ingenuity could invent
to sully, degrade, and ruin the mind of a young person. The
Almighty Creator of the Universe is caricatured by a set of grotesque
personages termed gods and goddesses, so grossly sensual,
so inordinately licentious, that were they to-day to appear in
London, before sunset they would probably be every one of them
where they ought to be&mdash;at the tread-mill. The poor boy, however,
must pore over all their amours, natural and unnatural;&mdash;he
must learn the birth, parentage, and education of each, with the
biography of their numerous offspring, earthly as well as unearthly.
He must study love-letters from the heavens to the earth, and
metamorphoses which have almost all some low, impure object.
The only geography he learns is &ldquo;the world known to the ancients.&rdquo;
Although a member of the first maritime nation on the
globe, he learns no nautical science but that possessed by people
who scarcely dared to leave their shores; all his knowledge of
military life is that childish picture of it which might fairly be entitled
&ldquo;war without gunpowder.&rdquo; But even the little which on
these subjects he does learn, is so mixed up with fable, that his
mind gets puzzled and debilitated to such a degree, that he becomes
actually unable to distinguish truth from falsehood, and when he
reads that Hannibal melted the Alps with vinegar, he does not
know whether it be really true or not.</p>

<p>In this degraded state, with the energy and curiosity of their
young minds blunted&mdash;actually nauseating the intellectual food
which they had once so naturally desired, a whole batch of boys at
the age of about fourteen<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> are released from their schools to go on
board men of war, where they are to strive to become the heroes
of their day. They sail from their country ignorant of almost
everything that has happened to it since the days of the Romans&mdash;having
been obliged to look upon all the phenomena of nature, as
well as the mysteries of art, without explanation, their curiosity for
information on such subjects has subsided. They lean against the
capstan, but know nothing of its power&mdash;they are surrounded by
mechanical contrivances of every sort, but understand them no
more than they do the stars in the firmament. They steer from
one country to another, ignorant of the customs, manners, prejudices,
or languages of any; they know nothing of the effect of
climate&mdash;it requires almost a fever to drive them from the sun; in
fact they possess no practical knowledge. The first lesson they
learn from adversity is their own guiltless ignorance, and no sooner
are they in real danger, than they discover how ill spent has been
the time they have devoted to the religion of the heathen&mdash;how
vain it is in affliction to patter over the names of Actæon and his
hounds!</p>

<p>That in spite of all these disadvantages, a set of high-bred,
noble-spirited young men eventually become, as they really do,
an honour to their country, is no proof that their early education
has not done all in its power to prevent them. But, to return to
those we left at our public schools.</p>

<p>As these boys rise, they become, as we all know, more and more
conversant in the dead languages, until the fatal period arrives,
when, proudly laden with these two panniers, they proceed to one
of our universities. Arriving, for instance, at Oxford, they find a
splendid high street, magnificently illuminated with gas, filled with
handsome shops, traversed by the mail, macadamized, and, like
every other part of our great commercial country, beaming with
modern intelligence. In this street, however, they are not permitted
to reside, but, conducted to the right and left, they meander
among mouldering monastic-looking buildings, until they reach the
cloisters of the particular college to which they are sentenced to
belong. By an ill-judged misnomer, they are from this moment
encouraged, even by their preceptors, to call each other <i>men</i>; and
a <i>man</i> of seventeen, &ldquo;too tall for school,&rdquo; talks of another <i>man</i> of
eighteen, as gravely as I always mention the name of my prototype
Methusalem. What their studies are, will sufficiently appear from
what is required of them, when they come before the public as
candidates for their degrees. At this examination, which is to give
them, throughout their country, the rank of finished scholars, these
self-entitled <i>men</i> are gravely examined first of all in Divinity,&mdash;and
then, as if in scorn of it, almost in the same breath, they descant
about the God of this vice, and the God of that; in short, they are
obliged to translate any two heathen authors in Latin, and any
other two in Greek, they themselves may select. They are next
examined in Aristotle&rsquo;s moral philosophy, and their examination,
like their education, being now concluded, their minds, being now
decreed to be brimfull, they are launched into their respective
grades of society, as accomplished, polished men, who have reaped
the inestimable advantages of a <i>good classical education</i>. But
it is not these gentlemen that I presume to ridicule; on the contrary,
I firmly believe that the 1200 students, who at one time
are generally at Oxford, are as high-minded, as highly talented,
as anxious to improve themselves, as handsome, and, in every
sense of the word, as fine a set of lads as can anywhere be met
with in a body on the face of the globe. I also know that all our
most estimable characters, all the most enlightened men our
country has ever produced, have, generally speaking, been members
of one of our universities; but, in spite of all this, will any
reasonable being seriously maintain that the workmanship has been
equal to the materials? I mean, that their education has been
equal to themselves?</p>

<p>Let any one weigh what they have <i>not</i> learnt against what they
have, and he will find that the difference is exactly that which
exists between creation itself and a satchel of musty books. I own
they are skilfully conversant in the latter; I own that they have
even deserved prizes for having made verses in imitation of Sappho&mdash;odes
in imitation of Horace&mdash;epigrams after the model of the
Anthologia, as well as after the mode of Martial; but what has the
university taught them of the former? Has it even informed them
of the discovery of America? Has it given them the power of
conversing with the peasant of any one nation in Europe? Has it
explained to them any one of the wonderful works of creation?
Has it taught them a single invention of art? Has it shown the
young landed proprietor how to measure the smallest field on his
estate? Has it taught him even the first rudiments of economy?
Has it explained to him the principle of a common pump? Has it
fitted him in any way to stand in that distinguished situation which
by birth and fortune he is honestly entitled to hold? Has it given
him any agricultural information, any commercial knowledge, any
acquaintance with mankind, or with business of any sort or kind;
and, lastly, has it made him modestly sensible of his own ignorance?&mdash;or
has it, on the contrary, done all in its power to make him feel
not only perfectly satisfied with his own acquirements, but contempt
for those whose minds are only filled with plain useful knowledge?</p>

<p>But it will be proudly argued, &ldquo;<em class="smcap">The University has taught him
Divinity!</em>&rdquo; In theory, I admit it may have done so; but, in all his
terms, has the student practically learnt as much Omnipotence as
the hurricane could explain to him in five minutes? To teach
young lads the simple doctrines of Christianity, is it advisable to
hide from their minds creation? It is advisable to allow them to
remain out of their colleges till midnight? But taking leave of the
university, let us, for a moment, consider the political effects of its
cramped, short-sighted, narrow-minded system.</p>

<p>On quitting their colleges, our young men, instead of being sensible,
that although they have read much that is ornamental, their
education has scrupulously avoided all that is useful&mdash;instead of
modestly feeling that they have to make up for lost time, and to
fight their way from nothing to distinction like subaltern officers in
our army, or like midshipmen in the navy, they have very great
reason to consider that, far from being literary vessels, rudely put
together, they are launched into society as perfect as a frigate from
its dock!</p>

<p>With respect to the drudgery of gaining honours, they feel that
they already possess them, can <i>produce</i> them, and true enough,
they show 1st class, 2nd class, and 3rd class honours, which are as
current in the country as the coin of the realm; and, with respect
to their education being <i>imperfect</i>, by universal consent, it has for
centuries been coupled with the most flattering adjectives;&mdash;it is
termed polite&mdash;elegant&mdash;accomplished&mdash;good&mdash;complete&mdash;excellent&mdash;regular&mdash;classical,
&amp;c., &amp;c. In literary creation these young
men conceive that they are luminaries, not specks&mdash;ornaments, not
blemishes! not merely in their own opinions, but by universal consent
and acclamation. Their political place is undeniably, therefore,
the helm, not before the mast; they are to guide, conduct,
steer the vessel of the state, not ignobly labour at its oar!</p>

<p>Accordingly, when they take their places in both houses of Parliament,
plunging at once into their own native element, they rise
up in the immediate presence of noblemen and gentlemen who not
only boast of having received exactly the same education as themselves,
but who, as youths, have proudly won the self-same honours
which they enjoy; and I here very humbly beg leave again to repeat,
that because our Parliament maintains, and always has maintained,
a front rank of men of undaunted resolution, transcendent
abilities, brilliant natural genius, and clear, comprehensive, enlightened
minds, it does not follow that the system of our public schools
and universities must necessarily be practically good. On the contrary,
it only proves that human institutions can no more extinguish
the native virtue, talent, and integrity of a country, than they can
hide from the world the light of the sun; but education can misdirect,
though it cannot annihilate; it can give the national mind
a hankering for unwholesome instead of wholesome food,&mdash;it can
encourage a passion for useless instead of useful information. On
its course high-bred lads may be trained to race against each other,
until the vain object they have strived for can never in after life
re-appear, but their blood warms within them.</p>

<p>Now supposing, for a single moment, that English education be
admitted to be as useless and dangerous as I have endeavoured to
describe it, let us consider what might naturally be expected to be
its practical political effects.</p>

<p>In our two houses of Parliament, classical eloquence would unavoidably
become the order of the day; and classical allusions,
when neatly expressed, would always receive that heartfelt cheer
which even the oldest among us are unable to withhold from what
reminds us of the pleasures and attachments of our early days.
Thus encouraged, young statesmen would feel their power rather
than their inexperience; and, with their minds stored with knowledge
declared to possess intrinsic value, they would not be very
backward in displaying it. Language, rather than matter, would
thus become the object of emulation&mdash;speeches would swell into
orations&mdash;and, in this contention and conflict of genius, men of
cleverness, ready wit, brilliant imagination, retentive memory,
caustic reply, and last, though not least, soundness of constitution,
would rise to the surface, far above those who, with much deeper
reflection, much heavier sense, more sterling knowledge, and more
powerful judgment, were yet found to be wanting in activity in their
parts of speech. Baffled, therefore, in their laconic attempts to expound
their uninteresting, ledger-like, unfashionable opinions, this
useful class of men would probably, by silence or otherwise, retire
from the unequal contest, which would become more and more of
an art, until extraordinary talent was required to carry political
questions so plain and simple, that were votes mutely to be given
by any set of hum-drum men, there would scarcely be a difference
in their opinions.</p>

<p>In the midst of this civil war, a young man, scarcely one-and-twenty
would be very likely rapidly to rise to be the Prime Minister
of our great commercial country! for although, if this world
teaches us any one moral, it is, that youth and inexperience are
synonymous; yet when talent only be the palm, surely none have
better right to contend for it than the young!</p>

<p>Seated on the exalted pinnacle which he has most fairly and honourably
attained, if not by general acclamation, at least by the
applauding voice of the majority, he must, of course, stand against
the intellectual tempest which has unnaturally brought a person of
his age to the surface. Accordingly, by the main strength of his
youthful genius, by his admitted superiority of talent, this beardless
pilot would probably triumphantly maintain his place at the helm&mdash;requiring,
however, support from those of his admirers most approaching
in eloquence to himself. To obtain the services of some
great orator, he would (copying the system of his opponents) be
induced to appoint a man, for instance, Secretary for the Colonies,
who on this earth had never reached the limits even of its temperate
zone; another, who had not heard a shot fired, or even seen a shell
in the air, would, perhaps, be created Master-General of our
Ordnance; in short, talent being the weapon or single-stick of Parliament,
he would, like others before him, arm himself with it at
any cost, and thus reign triumphant.</p>

<p>However, without supposing such an extreme case, let us fearlessly
recall to mind a miserable fact almost of yesterday. In the fatal
year 1825, the British government conceived the purely classical
and highly poetical idea of &ldquo;bringing a new world into existence!&rdquo;
Most people will remember with what flowery eloquence the elegant
project was laid before Parliament, and how loudly and generally
it was cheered&mdash;the blind were led by the blind&mdash;all our senators
being equally charmed at the splendid possibility of their thus politically
dabbling in creation. The truth or moral, however, came
upon us at last, like the simmoon upon the traveller who ignorantly
ventures on the deserts of Africa. The country almost foundered,
and though she has, to a certain degree, recovered from the shock,
yet thousands of widows, orphans, and people of small incomes,
are to this day, in indigence and sorrow, secretly lamenting the hour
in which the high-flown parliamentary project was disseminated.</p>

<p>The charity, pater-noster system of education pursued to this day
at our universities and public schools has produced other historical
facts, which it is now equally out of our power to obliterate, atone
for, or deny. For instance, we all know that in five years Charles II.
touched 23,601 of his subjects for the evil;&mdash;that our bishops invented
(just as Ovid wrote his &ldquo;Metamorphoses&rdquo;) a sort of heathen
service for the occasion;&mdash;that the unchristianlike, superstitious ceremony
was performed in public; and that as soon as prayers were
ended, we are told, &ldquo;<i>The Duke of Buckingham brought a towel,
and the Earl of Pembroke a basin and ewer, who, after they had
made obeisance to his Majesty, kneeled down till his Majesty
had washed.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again, everybody knows that Amy Drury and her daughter,
eleven years of age, were tried before &ldquo;the great and good Sir
Matthew Hale,&rdquo; then Lord Chief Baron, for witchcraft, and were
convicted and executed at Bury St. Edmund&rsquo;s, principally on the
evidence of Sir Thomas Brown, one of the first physicians and
scholars of his day: also that Dr. Wiseman, an eminent surgeon
of that period, in writing on scrofula, says&mdash;&ldquo;<i>However, I must
needs profess that His Majesty (Charles II.) cureth more in
any one year than all the chirurgeons of London have done in
an age.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The above degrading facts are moral tragedies, which were not
acted in a dark corner, by a few obscure strolling individuals&mdash;not
even by any great political faction,&mdash;but the audience was the
British nation&mdash;the performers the King on his throne, the bishops,
the nobility, the judges, the physicians, the philosophers of the day.
In short, theory and practice, hand in hand, both prove to the whole
world the double error in our system of education. Says theory&mdash;if
young people, instead of being taught to look at the ground
under their feet, at the heavens above their head, or at creation
around them, are forced by the rod to study events that never happened,
speeches that never were made, metamorphoses that never
took place, forms of worship and creeds ridiculous and impious, such
a nation must inevitably grow up narrow-minded, ignorant, superstitious,
and cruel. Says practice&mdash;this prophecy has been most
fatally fulfilled; and accordingly, in England, people <i>have</i> believed
in witchcraft&mdash;<i>have</i> put savage faith in the King&rsquo;s touch,&mdash;and,
under the name of a mild and merciful religion, they <i>have</i> burnt
each other to ashes at the stake!</p>

<p>The mute steadiness of British troops under fire,&mdash;the total
want of bluster or bravado in our naval actions, where, as we all
know,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;There is silence deep as death,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the boldest holds his breath<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For a time,&rdquo;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>the laconic manner in which business all over England is transacted
(millions being exchanged with little more than a nod of assent);
in short, our national respect for silent conduct, form a most extraordinary
contrast with the flatulent eloquence of our Parliamentary
debates.</p>

<p>But to return to our houses of Parliament: shall we now proceed
to calculate what would be the expense of such a system of
government or misgovernment as that which has just been shown
to have proceeded, not from the imbecility of individuals, but from
the system of false education maintained by our public schools and
universities? No! no! for the history of our country has already
solved this great problem, and, at this moment, does it record to
our posterity, as well as to the whole world, that the expense of a
great mercantile nation, looking behind it instead of before it&mdash;the
price of its statesmen studying ancient poets instead of modern discoveries&mdash;of
mistaking the &ldquo;orbis veteribus cognitus&rdquo; for the figure
of the earth, amounts to neither more nor less than a national debt
of <em class="smcap">eight hundred millions</em> of English pounds sterling! In short,
economy having fatally been classed at our universities among the
vulgar arts, the current expenses of our statesmen have naturally
enough been ordered to be put down to their children, just as their
college bills were carelessly ordered to be forwarded to their
fathers.</p>

<p>However, so long as a nation is <i>willing</i> to purchase at the above
enormous, or at any still greater price, the luxury of reading Greek
and Latin poetry, the misfortune at first appears to be only pecuniary;
and it might almost further be argued, that a nation, like an
individual, ought to be allowed to spend its money according to its
own whim or fancy; but, though this may or may not be true so
far as our money be concerned, yet there is an event which must
arrive, and in England this event <em class="smcap">has just arrived</em>, when a continuance
of such a mode of education must inevitably destroy our church,
aristocracy, funds; in short, every thing which a well-disposed
mind loves, venerates, and is desirous to uphold.</p>

<p>The fearful event to which I allude, is that of the lower classes
of people becoming enlightened.</p>

<p>In spite of all that party spirit angrily asserts to the contrary,
most firmly do I believe that there does not exist, in England, any
revolutionary spirit worth being afraid of. In a rich commercial
country, the idle, the profligate, and the worthless will always be
anxious to level the well-earned honours, as well as plunder the
wealth amassed by the brave, intelligent, and industrious; but every
respectable member of society, with the coolness of judgment natural
to our country, must feel that he possesses a stake, and enjoys
advantages which I firmly believe he is desirous to maintain;
in fact, not only the good feeling, but the good sense of the country,
support the fabric of our society, which we all know, like the army,
derives its spirit from possessing various honours (never mind whether
they be of intrinsic value or not) which we are all more or less
desirous to obtain.</p>

<p>But if those who wear these honours degrade themselves&mdash;if our
upper classes culpably desert their own standards&mdash;if they shall continue
to insist on giving to their children an elegant, useless education,
while the tradesman is filling his son with steady useful knowledge&mdash;if
our aristocracy, with the Goule&rsquo;s horrid taste, <i>will</i> obstinately
feed itself on dead languages, while the lower classes are
healthily digesting fresh wholesome food&mdash;if writing, arithmetic,
modern geography, arts, sciences, and discoveries of all sorts are to
continue (as they hitherto have been) to be most barbarously disregarded
at our public schools and universities, while they are carefully
attended to and studied by the poor&mdash;the moment must arrive when
the dense population of our country will declare that they can no
longer afford to be governed by classical statesmen; and, with an
equally honest feeling, they will further declare, they begin to find it
difficult to look up to people who have ceased to be morally their superiors.
That the lower orders of people in England are rising not
only in their own estimation, but in the honest opinion of the world,
is proved by the singular fact, that the wood-cuts of our <i>Penny Magazine</i>
(so rapidly printed by one of Clowes&rsquo;s great steam-presses) are
sent, in stereotype, to Germany, France, and Belgium, where they
are published, as with us, for the instruction of the lower classes.
The same Magazine is also sent to America (page for page) stereotyped.
The common people of England are thus proudly disseminating
their knowledge over the surface of the globe, while our
upper classes, by an infatuation which, without any exception, is the
greatest phenomenon in the civilized world, are still sentencing
their children to heathen, obscene, and useless instruction; and,
though it has beneficently been decreed &ldquo;<em class="smcap">Let there be light!</em>&rdquo; our
universities seriously maintain that the religious as well as moral
welfare of this noble country depends upon its continuing in intellectual
darkness.</p>

<p>It is now much too late in the day to argue whether the education
of the lower classes be a political advantage or not. One
might as well stand on the Manchester rail-road to stop its train,
as to endeavour to prevent that. The people, whether we like it or
not, <em class="smcap">will</em> be enlightened; and, therefore, without bewailing the
disorder, our simple and only remedy is, by resolutely breaking up
the system of our public schools and universities, to show the people
that we have nobly determined to become enlightened too.</p>

<p>The English gentleman (a name which, in the army, navy, hunting-field,
or in any other strife or contention, has always shown
itself able to beat men of low birth) will then hold his ground in the
estimation of his tenants, and continue to inhabit his estate. The
English nobleman, and the noble Englishman, will continue to be
synonymous&mdash;a well-educated clergy will continue to be revered&mdash;the
throne, as it hitherto has been, will be loyally supported&mdash;our
mercantile honour will be saved&mdash;<em class="smcap">the hopes of the radical will be
irretrievably ruined</em>&mdash;and when the misty danger at which we now
tremble has brightened into intellectual sunshine, remaining, as we
must do (as long as we continue to be the most industrious), the
wealthiest and first commercial nation on the globe, we shall
remember, and history will transmit to our children, that old-fashioned
prophecy of Faulconbridge, which so truly says,</p>

<p>I had retired to rest much pleased with Schlangenbad and all that
belonged to it, when about midnight I was awakened by a general
slamming of doors, windows, and shutters, occasioned by a most
violent gale of wind, and on opening my eyes, the bright moonlight
scene, which, without even moving my head, I beheld, was mysteriously
grand and imposing. Although the moon, which had just
risen, was as I lay not discernible through my windows, yet its silvery
light beamed so strongly that the two little white-washed mill-cottages
in the valley seemed to be even brighter than I had observed
them during the day. But what particularly attracted my
attention was the apparent writhing of those great hills which, as
if they had only just been rent asunder, hemmed me in. Every tree
on them was bending and waving from the violence of the squall,
and as cloud after cloud rapidly hurried across the moon, sometimes,
obscuring and then suddenly restoring to my view the strange prospect,
the uncertainty of this undulating movement gave a supernatural
appearance to the scene, which more resembled the fiction of a
dream, or of a romance, than any possible effect of wind on trees.
The clean, glistening foliage seemed scarcely able to stand against
the gale, which still continued to increase, until a loud peal of thunder,
followed by a few heavy drops, announced a calm, which was
no sooner established, than the light of the moon appeared to be
converted by Nature into a heavy deluge of rain. For some few
moments, I listened, I believe, to the refreshing sound, and to the
rushing of the stream beneath me; but as the darkness around me
increased, my eyes closed, and I again dropped off to sleep.</p>

<p>The little society of Schlangenbad, like that of most of the towns
and villages in this part of Germany, is composed of Lutherans,
Catholics, and Jews. The two former sects have each a place of
worship allotted to them in the Old Bad-Haus or Nassauer-Hof,
and their two chambers, standing nearly opposite to each other,
remind me very strongly of those twin-roads which in England
often lead from one little country town to another.</p>

<p>On each is the stranger invited to travel&mdash;one boasts that it is the
nearest by half a quarter of a mile, the other brags that &ldquo;it avoids
the hill.&rdquo; Such is the distinction between the two Christian sects
at Schlangenbad;&mdash;both start from the same point&mdash;both strain
for the same goal, and yet they querulously refuse to travel together.</p>

<p>After having spent two or three days in rambling up and down
the valley, searching for and admiring its sequestered beauties,
like Rasselas, I felt anxious to scale the mountains which surrounded
me, and accordingly inquired for a path, which, I was told, would
extricate me from my happy valley; however, after I had continued
on it some way, fancying I could attain the summit by a shorter
cut, I attempted to ascend the mountain by a straight course. For
some time I appeared to succeed pretty well, feeling every moment
encouraged at observing how high I had risen above the grassy
valley beneath; however, the mountain grew steeper, and the trees
thicker and larger, until I began to find that I had a much heavier
job on my hands than I had bargained for; nevertheless, upwards
I proceeded, winding my way through some magnificent oak timber,
until at last I attained actually the top of the mountain: yet so surrounded
was I by trees, that, very much to my disappointment,
I found it impossible to see ten yards before me. For a considerable
distance I walked along the ridge, hoping to find some gap or open
spot which would enable me to get a glimpse of the country beneath
me, but in vain,&mdash;for, go where I would, I was like a reptile
crawling through a field of standing corn; in short, nothing could
I see but trees, and even they appeared to be of no value, as a great
number of stately oaks were in every direction rotting just as if
they were beyond the reach and ken of mankind. As I was winding
between these timber trees, hoping, at least, to see deer or
wild game of some sort, it began to rain, and though I had no disposition,
on that account, to abandon my object, yet absolutely
not knowing where to seek it, I was almost in despair, when it
occurred to me to climb one of the trees; and the idea had no
sooner entered my head, than I felt quite angry with myself for
not having thought of it before: however, I was some little time
before I could find one to suit, for to swarm up the huge body of
any of the great oaks would have been quite impossible. As soon
as I found a tree adapted to my purpose and my age, I climbed it
in spite of the rain, and I was no sooner in the position of King
Charles the Second, than I witnessed one of the most splendid views
that can be well conceived.</p>

<p>Beneath me was the Rhine, glistening and meandering in its
course, while nearly opposite and beneath me lay Bingen, which
appeared to be basking on the banks of a lake. Almost every one
who has travelled on the Rhine speaks in raptures of this part of
it, yet the view I enjoyed, seated on the limb of my tree, was altogether
superior to what they could have witnessed, because at
one view I beheld the beauties which they had only successively
admired. The hills on which I was placed were clothed to their
summits with foliage, feathering down to the very water&rsquo;s edge;
and instead of the little portion of the river, which, as one niggles
along, is seen bit by bit from the steam-boat, its whole course
seemed to be displaying itself to my view. The opposite shore
was comparatively flat, and as far as I could see, a boundless fertile
wine country appeared to extend there. The shower, which was
still falling in heavy drops upon my tree, only belonged to the
mountain on which it stood, for the whole country and river beneath
were basking in sunshine. It was really delightful to enjoy
at once the sight of so many beautiful objects, and I hardly knew
whether to admire most the lovely little islands which seemed floating
at anchor in the Rhine, or the vast expanse of continent which
was prostrate before me; but without continuing the description,
any one who will only look in his map for Bingen, and then imagine
an old man seated in the clouds above it, will perceive what
a salient angle I occupied, and what a magnificent prospect I
enjoyed.</p>

<p>As soon as I had imbibed a sufficient dose of it, I commenced my
descent, which was of course easy enough when compared with the
fatigue I had suffered in attaining the object. The trees were dripping,
and the mossy surface of the ground made my feet equally
wet; however, rapidly descending, I soon got first a glimpse of my
own window in the New Bad-Haus, then a peep of the little quiet
mills whose wheels I saw slowly turning under the clear bright
water that sparkled above them; and really when I at last got down
to the green secluded valley of Schlangenbad, I felt that I would
not exchange its peaceful tranquillity for the possession of all the
splendid objects I had just witnessed.</p>

<p>Yet in viewing this humble scene, as well as in revelling over that
magnificent prospect where space and wood seemed to be infinite,
the very air smelling of health and freedom, there was a small feature
in the picture which gave me very painful reflections. There
are perhaps many who will say, that two or three peasants&rsquo; roofs
are specks, which (whatever sad secrets may lie hidden beneath
them) ought not to disturb the mind of the spectator, being objects
much too insignificant to be worthy of his notice; yet the more I observed
the splendour of the mountain scenery,&mdash;the more the
verdant valley seemed to rejoice,&mdash;the more the wild deer, dashing
by me, appeared to enjoy the gifts of creation,&mdash;the more difficult
did I find it to forget the abject poverty of the two or three poor
families which were inhabiting this smiling valley; and (on the
principle of not muzzling the ox that treadeth out the corn) it certainly
did seem to me hard, that, surrounded as these poor people
are by an almost boundless forest of timber trees, quantities of
which, stag-headed, are actually returning to the dust from which
they sprung, they should by the laws of their country be rigidly forbidden
to collect fuel to cheer the inclemency of the winter, or even
with their fingers to tear up a little wild grass beneath the trees for
their cow.</p>

<p>Considering that the storm, like the wind, cometh where it listeth,
afflicting the poor man even more than the well-sheltered rich
one, it seems hard, in districts so nearly uninhabited, that when the
oak tree is levelled with the ground, the mountain peasant who has
weathered the gale should be prevented from plundering this wreck
of the desolate forest in which he has been born. Nevertheless,
that such is the case, will be but too evident from the following
short extracts from a very long list of forest penalties, rigidly enforced
by the Duke of Nassau:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Should a sickle or scythe be used, the fine then becomes doubled; likewise for
a second trespass: for a third, imprisonment ensues.</p>

<p>It is against the Duke&rsquo;s laws to take birds&rsquo; nests; even those of birds of prey
cannot be taken without the permission of the keeper of the forests.</p>


<div class="left">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<tr><td align="left">For nightingales</td><td align="left">15 do.</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>Should the nest be taken out of a pleasure-ground, the fine then becomes doubled.</p>
</div>

<p>It may appear to many people quite impossible that these penalties
can be enforced in desolate districts so nearly uninhabited:
nevertheless, by a sort of diamond-cut-diamond system, the Duke&rsquo;s
forest officers have various cunning ways of detecting those who
infringe them, and the fact is that fuel and wild grass are very often
wanting in a solitary hovel absolutely environed by both. I myself
was one day told that I had become liable to be fined eighteen
kreuzers, because in a reverie I had allowed a rough pony I was
riding to bend his head down and eat a few mouthfuls of grass; and
another day, seeing a man who was driving the ass I was riding rub
with mud the end of a switch he had just cut, I was told by him,
in answer to my inquiry, that he did so in order that it might not be
proved he had <i>cut</i> it. However, lest these trifling data should not
be deemed sufficient proof, I will at once add, that I have myself
seen the peasants lying in the Duke&rsquo;s prison for having offended
against these petty laws.</p>

<p>I took some pains to inquire what possible objection there could
be to the poor people collecting a few dead leaves, or the rank wild
grass which grows here and there all over the forest, and I was told
that both of these by rotting are supposed to manure the trees, yet,
as I have already stated, quantities of the largest timber are to be
seen decaying in every direction.</p>

<p>In a crowded, populous country, all descriptions of property
must be clearly distinguished and most sternly protected; but in a
state of nature, or in districts so nearly approaching to it as many
parts of Nassau, the same rule is not applicable&mdash;the same necessity
does not exist; and under such circumstances, the punishment
inflicted upon a child for tearing up wild grass with his hands most
certainly is (and who can deny it?) greater than the offence.</p>

<p>It is with no hostile or bad feeling towards the Duke of Nassau
that I mention these details: he is a personage much beloved in
his duchy, and I believe with great reason is he respected there; yet
his forest laws no one surely can admire; and though custom certainly
has sanctioned them,&mdash;though the humble voice of those
who have suffered under them has hitherto been too feeble to reach
his ears,&mdash;and though those about his court and person are but
little disposed to awaken his attention to such mean complaints,&mdash;yet
no one can calmly see and foresee the state of political feeling
in Germany without admitting that the most humble traveller (and
why not an English one?) may render the Duke of Nassau a
friendly service, by bringing into daylight, unveiled by flattery, an
act of oppression in his government, which, while it has most probably
escaped his attention, is seditiously hoarded up by his political
enemies to form part of that fulcrum which they are secretly working
at, in order to effect by it, if possible, his downfall. A grievance,
like a wound, often only requires to be laid open to be cured;
whereas if, deeply seated, it be concealed from view, like gunpowder
imbedded in a rock, when once the spark <i>does</i> reach it, it
explodes with a violence proportionate to the power which would
vainly have attempted to smother it in the earth.</p>

<h2><a name="NIEDER-SELTERS" id="NIEDER-SELTERS">NIEDER-SELTERS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> in various countries drunk so much and heard so much
of the celebrated refreshing Selters or Selzer water, I determined one
lovely morning to exchange the pleasure of rambling about the
woods of Schlangenbad for the self-imposed duty of visiting the
brunnen of Nieder-Selters: accordingly, I managed to procure a
carriage, and with three post-horses away I trotted, sitting as upright
and as full of exuberant enjoyment as our great departed
lexicographer in his hack chaise. The macadamized road on which
I travelled, with the sight of men and boys sitting by its side, spitefully
cracking with slight hammers little stones upon flat big ones,
might easily have reminded me of old England; but five women,
each carrying on her head sixteen large stone bottles of Schlangenbad
water to wash the faces of the ladies of Schwalbach&mdash;the
dress of three peasants with long pipes in their mouths&mdash;a little
cart drawn by two cows&mdash;the Prince of Saxe Cobourg in a rough
carriage pulled by horses without blinkers and in rope harness&mdash;an
immense mastiff, driving before him to be slaughtered a calf not a
week old, and scarcely as high as himself&mdash;all these trifling incidents,
combined with the magnificent outline of wooded hills which
towered above the road, constantly reminded me that I was still
under the political roof and in the dominions of &ldquo;The Duke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On arriving at Schwalbach, I learned that the remainder of the
journey, which was to occupy six hours, was to be performed on
roads which, in the English language, are termed so very properly
&ldquo;cross.&rdquo; Accordingly, passing under the great barren hill appropriated
to the Schwein-General of Langen-Schwalbach, we followed
for some time the course of a green grassy valley, the herbage of
which had just been cut for the second time; and then getting into
a country much afflicted with hills, the horses were either straining
to ascend them, or suffering equally severely in the descent. In
many places the road was hardly as broad as the carriage, and as
there was generally a precipice on one side, I might occasionally
have felt a little nervous, had it not been for sundry jolts, happily
just violent enough to prevent the mind thinking of anything
else.</p>

<p>Passing the Eisenhammer, a water-mill lifting an immense hammer,
which forges iron by its fall (a lion which the water-drinkers
of Schwalbach generally visit), I proceeded through the village of
Neuhof to Würges, where we changed horses and, what was still
more important, bartered an old postilion for a young one. For
a considerable time our road ascended, passing through woods and
park-like plantations belonging to the Duke of Nassau&rsquo;s hunting-seat
&ldquo;Die Platte;&rdquo; at last we broke away from these coverts which had
environed us, traversing a vast undulating unenclosed country,
furrowed by ravines and deep valleys, many of which we descended
and ascended. The principal crops were potatoes, barley, oats,
rye, and wheat,&mdash;the three former being perfectly green, the two
latter completely ripe; and as it happened, from some reason or
other, that these sets of crops were generally sown on the same
sort of land, it constantly occurred that the entire produce of some
hills wore the green dress of spring, while other eminences were
as wholly clothed in the rich dusky garments of autumn. The
harvest, however, not having commenced, and the villages being,
generally speaking, hidden in the ravines, the crops often seemed
to be without owners. Descending, however, into valleys, we occasionally
passed through several very large villages, which were
generally paved, or rather studded with paving-stones; and as the
carriage-wheels hopped from one to another, the sensation (being
still too fresh in my memory) I had rather decline to describe: suffice
it to say, that the painful excitation vividly expressed in my
countenance must have formed an odd contrast with the dull, heavy,
half-asleep faces, which, as if raised from the grave by the rattling of
my springs as well as joints, just showed themselves at the windows,
as if to scare me as I passed. From poverty, their thin mountain
air and meagre food, the inhabitants of all these villages looked
dreadfully wan, and really there was a want of animation among
the young people, as well as the old, which it was quite distressing
to witness; the streets seemed nearly deserted, while the mud
houses, with their unpainted windows, appeared to be as dry and
cheerless as their inmates; here and there were to be seen children,
with hair resembling in colour and disorder a bunch of flax&mdash;but
no youthful merriment, no playfulness&mdash;in short, they were evidently
sapless chips off the old wooden blocks which were still gaping
at me from the window-frames.</p>

<p>At one of these solemn villages the postilion stopped at a &ldquo;gasthaus&rdquo;
to bait his horses. Odd as it may sound, it is nevertheless
true, that German post-horses have seldom what we should term
bridles. Snaffle-bits, ending with Ts instead of rings, being put
into their mouths, are hooked (by these Ts) to iron billets in the
head-pieces of common stable-halters, by which arrangement, to
feed the animals, it is only necessary, without taking them from the
carriage, to unhook one end of the bits, which immediately fall
from their mouths; a slight trough, on four legs, is then placed
before them, and the traveller generally continues, as I did, to sit
in his carriage watching the horses voraciously eating up slices of
black rye bread.</p>

<p>In England, there is no surer recipe known for making a pair of
horses suddenly run away with one&rsquo;s carriage, than by taking off
their blinkers to allow them to see it; but though our method decidedly
suits us the best, yet in Germany the whole system of managing
horses from beginning to end is completely different from
ours. Whether there is most of the horse in a German, or of the
German in a horse, is a nice point on which people might argue a
great deal; but the broad fact really is, that Germans live on more
amicable terms with their horses, and understand their dispositions
infinitely better, than the English: in short, they treat them as
horses, while we act towards them, and drill them, as if they were
men; and in case any one should doubt that Germans are better
horsemasters than we are, I beg to remind them of what is perfectly
well known to the British army&mdash;namely, that in the Peninsular
war the cavalry horses of the German legion were absolutely
fat, while those of our regiments were skin and bone.</p>

<p>In a former chapter I have already endeavoured to explain, that
instead of reining a horse&rsquo;s head <i>up</i>, as we do, for draught, the
Germans encourage the animal to keep it <i>down</i>; but besides this,
in all their other arrangements they invariably attend to the temper,
character, and instinct of the beast. For instance, in harness,
they intrust these sensible animals (who are never known to forget
what they have once seen) with the free use of their eyes. Their
horses see the wheel strike a stone, and they avoid the next one;
if they drag the carriage against a post, they again observe the
effect; and seeing at all times what is behind them, they know that
by kicking they would hurt themselves: when passengers and postilion
dismount, from attentive observation, they are as sensible as
we are that the draught will suddenly become less, and, consequently,
rejoicing at being thus left to themselves, instead of wishing
to run away, they invariably are rather disposed to stand still.</p>

<p>As soon as, getting tired, or, as we are often too apt to term it,
&ldquo;lazy,&rdquo; they see the postilion threaten them with his whip, they
know perfectly well the limits of his patience, and that after eight,
ten, or twelve threats, there will come a blow: as they travel along,
one eye is always shrewdly watching the driver&mdash;the moment he
begins the heavy operation of lighting his pipe, they immediately
slacken their pace, knowing, as well as Archimedes could have
proved, that he cannot strike fire and them at the same time: every
movement in the carriage they remark; and to any accurate observer
who meets a German vehicle, it must often be perfectly evident
that the poor horses know and feel, even better than himself,
that they are drawing a coachman, and three heavy baronesses
with their maid, and that to do that on a hot summer&rsquo;s day is&mdash;no
joke. When their driver urges them to proceed, he does it by degrees;
and they are stopped, not as bipeds, but in the manner quadrupeds
would stop themselves.</p>

<p>Now, though we all like our own way best, let us for a moment
(merely while the horses are feeding) contrast with the above description
our English mode of treating a horse.</p>

<p>In order to break in the animal to draught, we put a collar round
his neck, a crupper under his tail, a pad on his back, a strap round
his belly, with traces at his sides, and lest he should see that though
these things tickle and pinch, they have not power to do more, the
poor intelligent creature is blinded with blinkers; and in this fearful
state of ignorance, with a groom or two at his head and another
at his side, he is, without his knowledge, fixed to the pole and
splinter-bar of a carriage. If he kicks, even at a fly, he suddenly
receives a heavy punishment, which he does not comprehend&mdash;something
has struck him, and has hurt him severely; but, as fear
magnifies all danger, so, for aught we know or care, he may fancy
that the splinter-bar, which has cut him, is some hostile animal, and
expect, when the pole bumps against his legs, to be again assailed
in that direction.</p>

<p>Admitting that in time he gets accustomed to these phenomena,
becoming, what we term, steady in harness, still, to the last hour
of his existence, he does not clearly understand what it is that is
hampering him, or what is that rattling noise which is always at
his heels: the sudden sting of the whip is a pain with which he
gets but too well acquainted, yet the &ldquo;<i>unde derivatur</i>&rdquo; of the sensation
he cannot explain&mdash;he neither knows when it is coming, nor
where it comes from. If any trifling accident, or even irregularity,
occurs&mdash;if any little harmless strap, which ought to rest upon his
back, happens to fall to his side&mdash;the poor, noble, intelligent animal,
deprived of his eyesight, the natural lanterns of the mind,
is instantly alarmed; and though, from constant heavy draught, he
may literally, without metaphor, be on his last legs, yet if his blinkers
should happen to fall off, the sight of his own master&mdash;of his
very own pimple-faced mistress&mdash;and of his own fine yellow carriage
in motion&mdash;would scare him so dreadfully, that off he would
probably start, and the more they all pursued him the faster would
he fly!</p>

<p>I am aware that many of my readers, especially those of the
fairer sex, will feel disposed to exclaim&mdash;Why admire German
horses? Can there be any in creation better fed or warmer clothed
than our own? In black and silver harness are they not ornamented
nearly as highly as ourselves? Is there any amusement
in town which they do not attend? Do we not take them to the
Italian Opera, to balls, plays, to hear Paganini, &amp;c.; and don't they
often go to two or three routs of a night? Are our horses ever
seen standing before vulgar shops? And do they not drive to
church every Sunday as regularly as ourselves?</p>

<p>Most humbly do I admit the force of these observations; all I
persist in asserting is, that horses are foolishly fond of their eyesight&mdash;like
to wear their heads awkwardly, as Nature has placed them;
and that they have bad taste enough to prefer dull German grooms
and coachmen to our sharp English ones.</p>

<p>As soon as my horses had finished their black bread, all my idle
speculations concerning them vanished; the snaffle-bits were put
into their mouths&mdash;the trough removed&mdash;and on we proceeded to
a village where we again changed.</p>

<p>The features of the country now began to grow larger than
ever; and though crops, green and brown, were, as far as the eye
could reach, gently waving around me, yet the want of habitations,
plantations, and fences gave to the extensive prospect an air
of desolation: the picture was perhaps grand, but it wanted foreground;
however, this deficiency was soon most delightfully supplied
by the identical object I was in search of&mdash;namely, the brunnen
and establishment of Nieder-Selters, which suddenly appeared
on the road-side close before me, scarcely a quarter of a mile from
its village.</p>

<p>The moment I entered the great gate of the enclosure which,
surrounded by a high stone wall, occupies about eight acres of
ground, so strange a scene presented itself suddenly to my view,
that my first impression was, I had discovered a new world inhabited
by brown stone bottles; for in all directions were they to be
seen rapidly moving from one part of the establishment to another&mdash;standing
actually in armies on the ground, or piled in immense
layers or strata one above another. Such a profusion and such a
confusion of bottles it had never entered human imagination to
conceive; and, before I could bring my eyes to stoop to detail, with
uplifted hands I stood for several seconds in utter amazement.</p>

<p>On approaching a large circular shed, covered with a slated
roof, supported by posts, but open on all sides, I found the single
brunnen or well from which this highly celebrated water is forwarded
to almost every quarter of the globe&mdash;to India, the West
Indies, the Mediterranean, Paris, London, and to almost every
city in Germany. The hole, which was about five feet square,
was bounded by a framework of four strong beams mortised together;
and the bottom of the shed being boarded, it very much
resembled, both in shape and dimensions, one of the hatches in
the deck of a ship. A small crane with three arms, to each of
which there was suspended a square iron crate or basket, a little
smaller than the brunnen, stood about ten feet off; and while peasant
girls, with a stone bottle (holding three pints) dangling on
every finger of each hand, were rapidly filling two of these crates,
which contained seventy bottles, a man turned the third by a
winch, until it hung immediately over the brunnen, into which it
then rapidly descended. The air in these seventy bottles being
immediately displaced by the water, a great bubbling of course ensued;
but, in about twenty seconds, this having subsided, the crate
was raised; and, while seventy more bottles descended from another
arm of the crane, a fresh set of girls curiously carried off
these full bottles, one on each finger of each hand, ranging them
in several long rows upon a large table or dresser,&mdash;also beneath
the shed. No sooner were they there, than two men, with surprising
activity, put a cork into each; while two drummers, with a
long stick in each of their hands hammering them down, appeared
as if they were playing upon musical glasses.</p>

<p>Another set of young women now instantly carried them off,
four and five in each hand, to men who, with sharp knives, sliced
off the projecting part of the cork; and this operation being over,
the poor jaded bottles were delivered over to women, each of
whom actually covered 3000 of them a day with white leather,
which they firmly bound with packthread round the corks; and
then, without placing the bottles on the ground, they delivered
them over to a man seated beside them, who, without any apology,
dipped each of their noses into boiling hot rosin; and, before they
had recovered from this operation, the Duke of Nassau&rsquo;s seal was
stamped upon them by another man, when off they were hurried,
sixteen and twenty at a time, by girls to magazines, where they
peacefully remained ready for exportation.</p>

<p>Although this series of operations, when related one after another,
may sound simple enough, yet it must be kept in mind that
all were performed at once; and when it is considered that a three-armed
crane was drawing up bottles seventy at a time, from three
o'clock in the morning till seven o'clock at night (meal hours excepted),
it is evident that, without very excellent arrangement, some
of the squads either would be glutted with more work than they
could perform, or would stand idle with nothing to do:&mdash;no one,
therefore, dares to hurry or stop; the machinery, in full motion,
has the singular appearance which I have endeavoured to describe;
and certainly, the motto of the place might be that of old
Goethe&rsquo;s ring&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
&ldquo;<span class="small">Ohne hast, ohne rast.</span>&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>Having followed a set of bottles from the brunnen to the store,
where I left them resting from their labours, I strolled to another
part of the establishment, where were empty bottles calmly waiting
for their turn to be filled. I here counted twenty-five bins of bottles,
each four yards broad, six yards deep, and eight feet high. A number
of young girls were carrying thirty-four of them at a time on their
heads to an immense trough, which was kept constantly full by a
large fountain pipe of beautiful clear fresh water. The bottles on
arriving here were filled brimful (as I conceived for the purpose
of being washed), and were then ranged in ranks, or rather solid
columns, of seven hundred each, there being ten rows of seventy
bottles.</p>

<p>It being now seven o'clock, a bell rung as a signal for giving
over work, and the whole process came suddenly to an end: for
a few seconds, the busy labourers (as in a disturbed ant-heap) were
seen irregularly hurrying in every direction: but in a very short
time, all had vanished. For a few minutes I ruminated in solitude
about the premises, and then set out to take up my abode for
the night at the village, or rather town, of Nieder-Selters: however,
I had no sooner, as I vainly thought, bidden adieu to bottles,
than I saw, like Birnam Wood coming to Dunsinane, bottles approaching
me in every possible variety of attitude. It appears that
all the inhabitants of Nieder-Selters are in the habit of drinking in
their houses this refreshing water; but as the brunnen is in requisition
by the Duke all day long, it is only before or after work that
a private supply can be obtained: no sooner, therefore, does the
evening bell ring, than every child in the village is driven out of its
house to take empty bottles to the brunnen; and it was this singular-looking
legion which was now approaching me. The children
really looked as if they were made of bottles; some wore a pyramid
of them in baskets on their heads&mdash;some were laden with them
hanging over their shoulders before and behind&mdash;some carried
them strapped round their middle&mdash;all had their hands full; and
little urchins that could scarcely walk were advancing, each hugging
in its arms one single bottle. In fact, at Nieder-Selters, &ldquo;an
infant&rdquo; means a being totally unable to carry a bottle, puberty and
manhood are proved by bottles; a strong man brags of the number
he can carry; and a superannuation means a being no longer
able in this world to bear .... bottles.</p>

<p>The road to the brunnen is actually strewed with fragments, and
so are the ditches; and when the reader is informed that, besides
all he has so patiently heard, bottles are not only expended and exported,
but actually are <i>made</i> at Nieder-Selters, he must admit
that no writer can possibly do justice to that place unless every line
of his description contains, at least once, the word .... bottle. The
moralists of Nieder-Selters preach on bottles. Life, they say, is a
sound bottle, and death a cracked one&mdash;thoughtless men are empty
bottles&mdash;drunken men are leaky ones; and a man highly educated,
fit to appear in any country and in any society, is, of course, a bottle
corked, rosined, and stamped with the seal of the Duke of
Nassau.</p>

<p>As soon as I reached the village inn, I found there all the slight
accommodation I required: a tolerable dinner soon smoked on
the table before me; and, feeling that I had seen quite enough for
one day of brown stone bottles, I ventured to order (merely for a
change) a long-necked glass one of a vegetable fluid superior to all
the mineral water in the world.</p>

<p>The following morning, previous to returning to the brunnen, I
strolled for some time about the village; and the best analysis I
can offer of the Selters water is the plain fact, that the inhabitants
of the village, who have drunk it all their lives, are certainly, by
many degrees, the healthiest and ruddiest looking peasants I have
anywhere met with in the dominions of the Duke of Nassau.</p>

<p>This day being a festival, on reaching the brunnen at eleven
o'clock I found it entirely deserted&mdash;no human being was to be
seen: all had been working from three o'clock in the morning till
nine, but they were now at church, and were not to return to their
labour till twelve. I had, therefore, the whole establishment to
myself; and going to the famous brunnen, my first object was to
taste its water. On drinking it fresh from the source, I observed
that it possessed a strong chalybeate taste, which I had never perceived
in receiving it from the bottle. The three iron crates suspended
to the arms of the crane were empty, and there was nothing
at all upon the wooden dressers which, the evening before, I
had seen so busily crowded and surrounded: in the middle of the
great square were the stools on which the several cork-covering
women had sat; while, at some distance to the left, were the solid
columns or regiments of uncorked bottles, which I had seen filled
brimful with pure crystal water the evening before. On approaching
this brown looking army, I was exceedingly surprised at observing
from a distance that several of the bottles were noseless, and I
was wondering why such should ever have been filled, when, on
getting close to these troops, I perceived, to my utter astonishment,
that not only about one-third of them were in the same mutilated
state, but that their noses were calmly lying by their sides, supported
by the adjoining bottles! What could possibly have been
the cause of the fatal disaster which in one single night had so
dreadfully disfigured them, I was totally at a loss to imagine: the
devastation which had taken place resembled the riddling of an
infantry regiment under a heavy fire; yet few of our troops, even
at Waterloo, lost so great a proportion of their men as had fallen
in twelve hours among these immovable phalanxes of bottles. Had
they been corked, one might have supposed that they had exploded,
but why nothing but their noses had suffered I really felt quite incompetent
to explain.</p>

<p>As it is always better honestly to confess one&rsquo;s ignorance, rather
than exist under its torture, with a firm step I walked to the door
of the governor of the brunnen; and sending up to him a card,
bearing the name under which I travelled, he instantly appeared,
politely assuring me that he should have much pleasure in affording
any information I desired.</p>

<p>Instantly pointing to the noseless soldiers, my instructor was
good enough to inform me, that bottles in vast numbers being supplied
to the Duke from various manufactories, in order to prove
them, they are filled brimful (as I had seen them) with water, and
being left in that state for the night, they are the next morning visited
by an officer of the Duke, whose wand of office is a thin, long-handled,
little hammer, which at the moment happened to be lying
before us on the ground.</p>

<p>It appears that the two prevailing sins to which stone bottles are
prone, are having cracks, and being porous, in either of which cases
they, of course, in twelve hours, leak a little.</p>

<p>The Duke&rsquo;s officer, who is judge and jury in his own <i>court</i>-yard,
carries his own sentences into execution with a rapidity which even
our Lord Chancellor himself can only hope eventually to imitate.
Glancing his hawk-like eye along each line, the instant he sees a
bottle not brimful, without listening to long-winded arguments, he
at once decides &ldquo;that there can be no mistake&mdash;that there shall be
no mistake;&rdquo; and thus at one blow or tap of the hammer, off goes
the culprit&rsquo;s nose. &ldquo;So much for Buckingham!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Feeling quite relieved by this solution of the mystery, I troubled
the governor with a few questions, to reply to which he very kindly
conducted me to his counting-house, where, in the most liberal and
gentlemanlike manner, he gave me all the data I required.</p>

<p>The following, which I extracted from the daybook, is a statement
showing the number of bottles which were filled for exportation
during the year 1832, with the proportionate number filled
during each month.</p>

<p>Besides the above, there is a private consumption, amounting, on
an average, to very nearly half a million of bottles per annum.</p>

<p>It will, I hope, be recollected that by the time a bottle is sealed it
has undergone fifteen operations, all performed by different people.
The Duke, in his payments, does not enter into these details, but,
delivering his own bottles, he gives 17&nbsp;&frac12; kreuzers (nearly sixpence)
for every hundred, large or small, which are placed, filled, in his
magazines. The peasants, therefore, either share their labour and
profits among themselves, or the whole of the operations are occasionally
performed by the different members of one family; but so
much activity is required in constantly stooping and carrying off
the bottles, that this work is principally performed by young
women of eighteen or nineteen, assembled from all the neighbouring
villages; and who, by working from three in the morning till
seven at night, can gain a florin a day, or 30 florins a month,
Sunday (excepting during prayers) not being, I am sorry to say, at
Nieder-Selters, a day of rest.</p>

<p>For the bottles themselves the Duke pays 4&nbsp;&frac12; florins per cent.
for the large ones, and 3 florins per cent. for the small ones.
The large bottles, when full, he sells at the brunnen for 13 florins a
hundred.</p>

<p>His profit, last year, deducting all expenses, appeared to be, as
nearly as possible, 50,000 florins; and yet, this brunnen was
originally sold to the Duke&rsquo;s ancestor for a single butt of wine!</p>

<p>On coming out of the office, the establishment was all alive again,
and the peasants being in their Sunday clothes, the picture was
highly coloured. Young women in groups of four and five, with
little white or red caps perched on the tops of their heads, from
which streamed three or four broad ribands, of different colours,
denoting the villages they proceeded from, in various directions,
singing as they went, were walking together, heavily laden with
bottles. They were dressed in blue petticoats, clean white shifts
tucked up above the elbows, with coloured stays laced, or rather
half unlaced, in front. Old women, covering the corks with leather,
in similar costume, but in colours less gaudy, were displaying an
activity much more vigorous than their period of life. Across this
party-coloured, well-arranged system, which was as regular in its
movements as the planets in their orbits, an officer of the Duke,
like a comet, occasionally darted from the office to the brunnen, or
from the tiers of empty bottles which had not yet been proved, to
the magazine of full ones ready to embark on their travels.</p>

<p>In quitting the premises, as I passed the regiments of bottles, an
operation was proceeding which I had not before witnessed.
Women in wooden shoes were reversing the full bottles; in fact,
without driving these brown soldiers from their position, they were
making them stand upon their heads instead of upon their heels&mdash;the
object of this military somerset being to empty them; however,
every noseless bottle, water and all, was hurled over a wall, into a
bin prepared on purpose to receive them; and the smashing sound
of devastation which proceeded from this odd-looking operation it
would be very difficult to describe.</p>

<p>Having now witnessed about as much as I desired of the lively
brunnen of Nieder-Selters, I bade adieu to this well-regulated establishment,
feeling certain that its portrait would, in future, re-appear
before my mind, in all its vivid colours whensoever and
wheresoever I might drink the refreshing, wholesome beverage obtained
from its bright, sparkling source. My carriage had long
been waiting at the gate: however, having aroused my lumbering
and slumbering driver, I retraced my steps, was slowly re-jolted
homewards, and it was late before I reached my peaceful abode in
the gay, green little valley of Schlangenbad.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MONASTERY_OF_EBERBACH" id="THE_MONASTERY_OF_EBERBACH">THE MONASTERY OF EBERBACH.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Exactly</span> at the appointed moment, Luy with his favourite ass,
Katherinchen, appeared at the door of the new Bad-Haus; the day,
overcast with clouds, was quite cool, and, under such favourable
auspices, starting at twelve o'clock, in less than a hundred yards we
were all hidden in the immense forest which encircles that portion
of the duchy of Nassau which looks down upon the Maine and the
Rhine. For about an hour, the ass, who after the second turn
seemed to be perfectly sensible where she was carrying me, patiently
threaded her way along narrow paths, which, constantly
crossing each other at various angles, seemed sufficient to puzzle
even the brain of a philosopher: however, although human intellect
is said to be always on the march, yet we often find brute instinct
far before it; and certainly it did appear that Katherinchen&rsquo;s knowledge
of the carte du pays of Nassau was equal almost to that of
&ldquo;The Duke&rdquo; himself. Sometimes we suddenly came to tracks of
wheels which seemed to have been formed by carriages that had
not only dropped from, but had returned back to, the clouds, for
they began <i>à propos</i> to nothing, and vanished in an equally unaccountable
manner. Sometimes we came to patches bare of timber,
except here and there an old oak left on purpose to supply acorns
for the swine; then again we followed a path which seemed only to
belong to deer, being so narrow that we were occasionally obliged
to force our way through the bushes; at last, all of a sudden, I
unexpectedly found myself on the very brink of a most picturesque
and precipitous valley.</p>

<p>Close above me, standing proudly on its rock, and pointing to a
heavy white cloud which happened at the moment to be passing
over it, was the great pillar or tower of Sharfenstein, a castle formerly
the residence of the bishops of Mainz. The village of Kiedrich
lay crouching at a considerable depth beneath, the precipitous
bank which connected us with it being a vineyard, in which every
here and there were seen flights of rough stone steps, to enable the
peasants to climb to their work. By a rocky path, about a foot or
nine inches broad, Katherinchen, with Luy following as if tied to
her tail, diagonally descended through this grape garden, until we
at last reached the village mill, the wheel of which I had long observed
indolently turning under a stream of water scarcely heavy
enough for its purpose. The little village of Kiedrich, as I rode by
it, appeared to be a confused congregation of brown hovels and
green gardens, excepting a large slated mansion of the Baron von
Ritter, whose tower of Sharfenstein now seemed in the clouds, as
if to draw the lightning from the village; and almost breaking my
neck to look up to it, I could not help feeling, as I turned towards
the east, how proud its laird must be at seeing every morning its
gigantic shadow lying across the valley, then paying its diurnal visit
to every habitation, thus eclipsing for a few moments, from each
vassal, even the sun in the heavens.</p>

<p>After passing Kiedrich, I again entered the forest, and for above
an hour there was little to be seen except the noble trees which encompassed
me; but the mind soon gets accustomed to ever so short
a tether, and though I could seldom see fifty yards, yet within that
distance there existed always plenty of minute objects to interest me.
The foliage of the beeches shone beautifully clear and brilliant, and
there were new shoots, which, being lighter in colour than the old,
had much the appearance of the autumnal tint, yet when the error
was discovered, one gladly acknowledged that youth had been mistaken
for age. The forest now suddenly changed from beech trees
into an army of oaks, which seemed to be, generally speaking, about
fifty years of age; among them, however, there stood here and
there a few weather-beaten veterans, who had survived the race of
comrades with whom they had once flourished; but we must drop
the military metaphor, for their hearts were gone&mdash;their bodies
had mouldered away&mdash;nothing but one side was left&mdash;in fact, they
were more like sentry-boxes than sentinels, and yet, in this decayed
state, they were decked with leaves as cheerfully as the rest. In
this verdant picture, there was one pale object which, for a few
moments, as I passed it, particularly attracted my attention; it
was an immense oak, which had been struck dead by lightning;
it had been, and indeed still was, the tallest to be seen in the forest,
and pride and presumption had apparently drawn it to its fate.
Every leaf, every twig, every small branch was gone; barkless&mdash;blasted&mdash;and
blanched&mdash;its limbs seemed stretched into the harshest
outlines; a human corpse could not form a greater contrast with a
living man, than this tree did with the soft green foliage waving
around it: it stood stark&mdash;stiff&mdash;jagged as the lightning itself; and
as its forked, sapless branches pointed towards the sky, it seemed
as if no one could dare pass it without secretly feeling that there
exists a power which can annihilate as well as create, and that
what the fool said in his heart&mdash;was wrong! I, however, had not
much time for this sort of reflection, for whenever Katherinchen,
coming to two paths, selected the right one, Luy from behind was
heard loudly applauding her sagacity, which he had previously declared
to be superior to that of all the asses in Nassau&mdash;and yet,
Luy, in his more humble department, deserved quite as much praise
as Katherinchen herself.</p>

<p>He was a slender, intelligent, active man, of about thirty, dressed
in a blue smock frock, girded round the middle by the buff Nassau
belt: and though, from some cause or other, which he could never
satisfactorily account for, his mouth always smelt of rum, yet he
was never at a loss&mdash;always ready for an expedition, and foot-sore
or not, the day seemed never long enough to tire him. The fellow
was naturally of an enterprising disposition, and the winters in
Nassau being long and cheerless, it occurred to Luy on his march,
that were he with Katherinchen and his other two asses to go to
England (of which he had only heard that it was the richest country
under the sun), they would no doubt there be constantly employed
for the whole twelvemonth, instead of only finding lady and gentleman
riders at Schlangenbad for a couple of months in the year.
His project appeared to himself a most brilliant one, and though I
could not enter into it quite as warmly as he did (indeed I almost
ruined his hopes by merely hinting that our sea, which he had
never heard of, might possibly object to his driving asses from
Schlangenbad to London), yet I inwardly felt that poor Luy&rsquo;s speculation
had quite as sound a foundation, displayed quite as much
knowledge of the world, and had infinitely less roguery in it, than
the bubble projects of more civilized countries, which have too
often eventually turned out to be nothing more nor less than ass-driving
with a vengeance.</p>

<p>After winding my way through the trees for a considerable
time, inclining gently to the left, I suddenly saw close before me,
at the bottom of a most sequestered valley, the object of my journey,&mdash;namely,
the very ancient monastery of <em class="smcap">Eberbach</em>. The
sylvan loveliness, and the peaceful retirement of this spot, I strongly
feel it is quite impossible to describe. Almost surrounded by hills
or rather mountains, clothed with forest trees, one does not expect
to find at the bottom of such a valley an immense solitary building,
which in size and magnificence not only corresponds with the bold
features of the country, but seems worthy of a place in any of the
largest capitals of Europe.</p>

<p>The irregular building, with its dome, spires, statues, and high
slated roofs, looks like the palace of some powerful king; and yet
the monarch has apparently no subjects but the forest trees, which
on all sides almost touch the architecture, and even closely environ
the garden walls.</p>

<p>A spot better suited to any being or race of beings who wished
to say to the world &ldquo;<i>Fare thee well! and if for ever, still for
ever fare thee well!</i>&rdquo; could scarcely be met with on its vast circumference;
and certainly if it were possible for the vegetable
creation to compensate a man for losing the society of his fellow-creatures,
the woods of Eberbach would, in a high degree, afford
him that consolation. A more lovely and romantic situation for
a monastery could not have existed; yet I should have wondered
how it could possibly have been discovered, had not its history
most clearly explained that marvel.</p>

<p>In the year 1131, St. Bernhard, the famous preacher of the crusade
(whose followers eventually possessed, merely in the Rhine-gau,
six monastic establishments&mdash;namely, Tiefenthal, Gottesthal,
Eberbach, Eibinger, Nothgottes, and Marienhausen), was attacked
by a holy itch, or irresistible determination to erect a monastery;
but not knowing where to drop the foundation-stone, he consulted,
it is said, a wild boar, on this important subject. The sagacious
creature shrewdly listened to the human being who addressed it;
and a mysterious meeting being agreed upon, he silently grubbed
with his snout, the valley of Eberbach, lines marking out the
foundation of the building; and certainly such a lovely stye, for
men basking in sunshine, to snore away their existence, no animal
but a pig would ever have thought of!</p>

<p>St. Bernhard, highly approving of the boar&rsquo;s taste, employed
the best architects to carry his plan into execution; and sparing no
expense, a magnificent cathedral&mdash;a large palace, with a monastery,
connected together by colonnades, as well as ornamented in
various places with the image of a pig, its founder&mdash;were quickly
reared upon the spot; and when all was completed, monks were
brought to the abode, and the holy hive, for many centuries, was
heard buzzing in the wild mountains which surrounded it: however,
in the year 1803, the Duke of Nassau took violent possession of its
honey, and its inmates were thus rudely shaken from their cells.
Three or four of the monks, of this once wealthy establishment, are
all that now remain in existence, and their abode has ever since
been used partly as a government prison, and partly as a public
asylum for lunatics.</p>

<p>Before entering the great gate, which was surmounted by colossal
figures of the Virgin Mary, St. John, and the great St. Bernhard
himself, I was advised by my cicerone, Luy, to go to some
grotto he kept raving about; and, as Katerinchen&rsquo;s nose also seemed
placidly to point the same way, I left the monastery, and through a
plantation of very fine oaks, which were growing about twenty feet
asunder, we ascended, by zigzags, a hill surmounted by a beautiful
plantation of firs; and the moment I reached the summit, there
suddenly flashed upon me a view of the Rhine, which, without any
exception, I should say, is the finest I have witnessed in this country.
Uninterrupted by anything but its own long, narrow islands, I beheld
the course of the river, from Johannisburg to Mainz, which
two points formed, from the grotto where I stood, an angle of about
120 degrees. Between me and the water, lay, basking in sunshine,
the Rhine-gau, covered with vineyards, or surrounded by
large patches of corn, which were evidently just ready for the sickle;
but the harvest not having actually commenced, the only moving
objects in the picture were young women with white handkerchiefs
on their heads, busily pruning the vines; and the Coln, or, as it
might more properly be termed, the <i>English</i> steam-boat, which,
immediately before me, was gliding against the stream towards
Mainz. On the opposite side of the Rhine, an immense country,
highly cultivated, but without a fence, was to be seen.</p>

<p>Turning my back upon this noble prospect, the monastery lay
immediately beneath me, so completely surrounded by the forest,
that it looked as if, ready built, it had been dropped from heaven
upon its site.</p>

<p>A more noble-looking residence could hardly be imagined, and
the zigzag walks and plantations of fir imparted to it a gentlemanlike
appearance, which I could not sufficiently admire; yet, notwithstanding
the rural beauty of the place, I felt within me a strong
emotion of pity for those poor, forlorn, misguided beings, whose
existence had been uselessly squandered in such mistaken seclusion;
and I could not help fancying how acutely, from the spot on which
I stood, they might have compared the moral loneliness of their
mansion, with the natural joy and loveliness of that river scenery,
from which their relentless mountain had severed them: indeed,
I hope my reader will not think an old man too Anacreontic for
saying, that if any thing in this world could penetrate the sackcloth
garment of a monk, &ldquo;and wring his bosom,&rdquo; it would be the
sight of what I had just turned my back upon&mdash;namely, a vineyard
full of women! That the fermentation of the grape was intended
to cheer decrepitude, and that the affections of a softer sex were
made to brighten the zenith of mid-day life, are truths which,
within the walls of a convent or a monastery, it must have been
most exquisite torture to reflect upon.</p>

<p>As I descended from the grotto, I saw beneath me, entering
the great gate of the building, half a dozen carts laden with wood,
each drawn by six prisoners. None being in irons, and the whole
gang being escorted by a single soldier in the Nassau uniform, I
was at first surprised,&mdash;why, when they penetrated the forest, they
did not all run away! However, fear of punishment held them
together: there being no large cities in the duchy, they had no
where to run, but to their own homes, where they would instantly
have been recaptured; and though, to a stranger like myself, the
forest seemed to offer them protection, yet it was certain death
by starvation to remain in it.</p>

<p>On entering the great square, I found it would be necessary to
apply to the commandant of the establishment for permission to
view it. I accordingly waited upon him, and was agreeably surprised
at being politely informed by him, in English, that he would
be proud and most happy to attend me. He was a fine, erect,
soldierlike-looking man, of about forty, seventeen years of which
he had reigned in this valley, over prisoners and lunatics; the
average number of the former being 250, and of the latter about
100.</p>

<p>As I was following him along some very handsome cloisters, I
observed, hanging against a wall, twenty-five pictures in oil, of
monks, all dressed in the same austere costume, and in features
as in dress so much resembling each other, that the only apparent
distinction between them was the name of each individual, whose
barren, useless existence was thus intended to be commemorated
beyond the narrow grave which contained him. Ascending a
stone staircase, I now came to the lower division of the prison, one
half being appropriated to women, and the other to men.</p>

<p>Although I had been for the whole day enjoying pure fresh air,
yet the establishment was so exceedingly clean, that there was no
smell of any sort to offend me. The monks&rsquo; cells had in many
places been thrown by threes into large rooms for tailors, weavers,
carpenters, shoemakers, &amp;c., &amp;c.,&mdash;each of these trades working
separately, under the direction of one overseer. In all these chambers
every window was wide open, the walls were white-washed, and
the blanched floors were without a stain; indeed, this excessive
cleanliness, although highly praised by me, and exceedingly attractive
to any English traveller, probably forms no small part of
the punishment of the prison, for there is nothing that practically
teases dirty people more than to inflict upon them foreign habits
of cleanliness. The women&rsquo;s rooms were similarly arranged, and
the same cleanliness and industry insisted upon; while, for younger
culprits, there was an excellent school, where they were daily
taught religious singing, reading, writing, arithmetic, and weaving.
Having finished with this floor, I mounted to the upper story,
where, in solitary cells, were confined patients who had relapsed,
or, in plainer terms, culprits who had been convicted a second
time of the same offence.</p>

<p>Many of these unfortunate people were undergoing a sentence
of three, four, and five years&rsquo; imprisonment; and to visit them,
as I did, in their cells, was, I can assure my reader, anything but
pleasing. On the outside of each door hung a small black board,
upon which was laconically inscribed, in four words, the name and
surname of the captive&mdash;his or her offence&mdash;and the sentence.
I found that their crimes, generally speaking, were what we should
call petty thefts&mdash;such as killing the Duke&rsquo;s game&mdash;stealing his
wood&mdash;his grass, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>As I paid my melancholy visits, one after another, to these
poor people, I particularly observed that they seemed, at least,
to be in the enjoyment (if, without liberty, it may be so termed)
of good health; the natural effect of the cool, temperate lives
they were obliged to lead, and of the pure fresh air which came
to each of them through a small open window; yet so soon as their
doors were opened, there was an eagerness in their countenances,
and a peculiar anxiety in their manner of fixing their eyes upon
mine, which seemed to curdle into despondency, as the door was
rapidly closed between us. Each individual had some work to
perform&mdash;one man had just finished a coffin for a poor maniac
who had lately ended his melancholy career&mdash;the lid, instead of
being flat, was a prism of many sides, and, on the upper slab, there
was painted in black a cross, very nearly the length of the coffin.</p>

<p>So long as the soldier, in his buff belt, who attended the commandant,
continued to unlock for me, and lock, the dungeons of the
male prisoners, so long did I feel myself capable of witnessing their
contents; for to see <i>men</i> suffer, is what we are all, more or less,
accustomed to; but as soon as he came to the women&rsquo;s cells, I felt,
certainly for the first time in my existence, that I should be obliged
to abandon my colours, and cease to be of the scene before me&mdash;a
&ldquo;reviewer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the countenance of the very first female captive that I beheld
I could not but remark a want of firmness, for the possession of
which I had not given to the other sex sufficient credit&mdash;the poor
woman (to be sure she might have been a mother) showed an
anxiety for her release, which was almost hysterical; and hurrying
towards me, she got so close to the door, that it was absolutely forcibly
slammed by the soldier, almost in her face.</p>

<p>In the third cell that I came to, there stood up before me, with
a distaff in her hand, a young slight-made peasant-girl of about
eighteen; her hair was black, and her countenance seemed to me
beaming with innocence and excessive health. She was the only
prisoner who did not immediately fix her eyes upon mine; but,
neither advancing nor retiring, she stood, looking downwards, with
an expression of grief, which I expected every moment, somewhere
or other, would burst into tears. Such a living picture of youthful
unhappiness I felt myself incapable of gazing upon; and the
door, being closed upon her, was no sooner locked, than I thanked
the commandant for his civility, adding, that I would not trouble
the soldier to open any more of the cells, observing, as an excuse,
that I perceived they were all alike.</p>

<p>After standing for some time listening to the rules and discipline
of the prison, I inquired of the commandant whether he had any
prisoners confined for any greater crimes than those which I have
already mentioned, to which he replied in the negative; and he was
going to descend the staircase, when I asked him, as coldly as I
could, to be so good as to state for what offence the young person
I had just left was suffering so severely. The commandant, with
silent dignity, instantly referred me to the little black board, on which
was written the girl&rsquo;s name (I need not repeat it) and her crime,
which, to my very great astonishment, turned out to be &ldquo;<em class="smcap">dissolute</em>;&rdquo;
and it was because she had been convicted a second time
of this offence, that she was imprisoned, as I saw her, in a cell,
which, like all the others, had only one small window in the roof,
from which nothing was to be seen but what she, perhaps, least
dared to look at&mdash;the heavens! I certainly, from her appearance,
did not judge rightly of her character: however, upon such points I
neither outwardly profess, nor inwardly do I believe myself, to be
what is vulgarly termed&mdash;knowing. Had I looked into the poor
girl&rsquo;s countenance for guilt, it is most probable I should not have
searched there in vain, but, at her age, one sought for feelings of a
better cast; and, notwithstanding what was written on the black
board, those feelings most certainly did exist, as I have very faintly
described them.</p>

<p>I now accompanied the commandant (going along, I may just
observe, that he had learned English from his father, who had
served as an officer in our German Legion) to another part of the
monastery, which had long been fitted up as an asylum for lunatics,
most of whom were provided for by the Nassau government, the
rest being people of family, supplied with every requisite by their
friends.</p>

<p>There was but little here which particularly attracted my attention.
In clean, airy rooms, formed out of three cells, as in the
prison, there lived together from eight to ten lunatics, many of
whom appeared to be harmless and even happy, although, in the
corner of the room, there certainly was a large iron cage for refractory
or dangerous patients. In one of these groups stood a
madman, who had been a medical student. He was about thirty
years of age, extremely dark, exceedingly powerfully made,&mdash;and
no sooner did I enter the room, than raising his eyes from a book
which he was reading, he fixed them (folding his arms at the time)
upon me, with a ferocity of countenance, which formed a very
striking contrast to the expression of imbecility which characterized
the rest of his companions. The longer he looked at me, the
deeper and the darker was his frown; and though I steadily returned
it, yet, from the flashing of his eyes, I really believe that
like a wild beast, he would have sprung upon me, had I not followed
the soldier to the next room.</p>

<p>Having inspected the great apartments, I next visited the cells
in which were confined those who were not fitted for intercourse
with others; they were generally of a gloomy temperament. Some
were lying on their beds, apparently asleep; while some, particularly
women, actually tried to escape, but were mildly repressed
by the commandant, whose manner towards them seemed to be an
admirable mixture, in about equal parts, of mildness and immovable
firmness.</p>

<p>I should have continued along the passage which connected
these cells, but the poor creature, whose coffin I had seen, was
lying there; I therefore left the building, and went into a great
garden of the monastery, filled with standard fruit-trees, which
had been planted there by the monks. In this secluded spot there
was a sort of summer-house, where the worst lunatic cases were
in confinement; none, however, were in chains; though some were
so violent, that the commandant made a sign to the soldier not to
disturb them.</p>

<p>Having now very gratefully taken leave of the deserving officer
in charge of this singular establishment for crime and lunacy, the
whole of which was kept in complete subjection by a garrison of
eight soldiers, for a considerable time I strolled alone about the
premises. Sometimes I looked at ancient figures of a boar, which
I found in more than one place, rudely carved both on wood and
stone; then I wandered into the old cathedral, which was now
strangely altered from the days of its splendour, for the glass in its
Gothic windows having been broken, had been plastered up with
mud, and upon the tombs of bishops and of abbots there was lying
corn in sheaves,&mdash;heaps of chaff,&mdash;bundles of green grass.</p>

<p>My attention was now very particularly attracted by the venerable
entrance-gate of the monastery, which, on turning a corner,
suddenly appeared before me, surmounted by colossal statues of
the Great St. Bernhard with his crosier&mdash;of St. John, holding a
long thin cross, at the foot of which there was seated a lamb&mdash;and
of the Virgin Mary, who, with a glory round her head, and an
olive branch in her hand, stood in the centre, considerably exalted
above both.</p>

<p>The sun had long ago set&mdash;and I was no sooner immediately
under the great arched gateway, than, leaning on my staff, I stood
as it were riveted to the ground at the sight of the moon, which,
having risen above the great hill, was shining directly upon the
picturesque pile and images above my head.</p>

<p>As in silence and solitude I gazed upon the lovely planet, which
majestically rose before me, growing brighter and brighter as the
daylight decayed, I could not help feeling what strange changes she
had witnessed in the little valley of Eberbach! Before the recorded
meeting of the &ldquo;sus atque sacerdos,&rdquo; she had seen it for ages and
ages existing alone in peaceful retirement&mdash;one generation of oaks,
and beech-trees had been succeeded by another, while no human
being had felt disposed either to flourish or to decay among this
vegetable community. After this solemn interview with the pig,
she had seen the great St. Bernhard collecting workmen and materials,
and as in the midst of them he stood waving his cross, she
had observed a monastery rise as if by magic from the earth,
rapidly overtopping the highest of the trees which surrounded it.
In the days of its splendour she had witnessed provisions and revenues
of all sorts entering its lofty walls, but though processions
glittered in its interior, nothing was known by her to have been
exported to save a matin and vesper moan, which, accompanying the
wind as it swept along the valley, was heard gradually dying, until,
in a few moments, it had either ceased to exist, or it had lost itself
among the calm, gentle rustling of the leaves. Lastly, she had seen
the monks of St. Bernhard driven from their fastness&mdash;and from
their holy cells. As with full splendour she had since periodically
gazed at midnight upon the convent, too often had she heard&mdash;first,
the scream of the poor maniac, uttered, as her round gentle light
shone mildly upon his brain; and then his wild laugh of grief, as,
starting from a distempered sleep, he forced his burning forehead
against the barred window of his cell, as if, like Henri Quatre,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center blockquot">
&ldquo;Pour prendre la lune avec les dents.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>As she proceeded in her silent course, shining successively into
each window of the monastery, how often did she now see the
criminal lying on the couch of the bigot&mdash;and the prostitute solitarily
immured in the cell of celibacy! The madman is now soundly
sleeping where the fanatic had in vain sought for repose&mdash;and the
knave unwillingly suffering for theft where the hypocrite had voluntarily
confined himself!</p>

<p>From a crowd of these reflections, which, like mushrooms,
rapidly grew up by the light of the moon, I was aroused by Katherinchen
and her satellite Luy, whose heads (scarcely visible from
the shadow of the great gateway), pointing homewards, mildly
hinted that it was time I should return there; but on my entering
the convent, rather an odd scene presented itself. The supper of
the lunatics, distributed in separate plates, being ready in the great
kitchen, like a pack of hounds, they were all of a sudden let loose,
and their appetites sufficiently governing their judgments, each
was deemed perfectly competent to hunt for his own food, which
was no sooner obtained, than, like an ant, he busily carried it off
to his cell. The prisoners were also fed from another kitchen at
the same hour; and as certain cravings, which with considerable
dignity I had long repressed, were painfully irritated by the very
savoury smells which assailed me, stopping for a moment, I most
gladly partook of the madman&rsquo;s fare, and then, full of soup and of
the odd scenes I had witnessed, leisurely seating myself in my
saddle, guided by Katherinchen, and followed by Luy, we retraced
our intricate paths through the forest, until, late at night, we found
ourselves once again in sight of the little lamps which light up the
garden and bowers of my resting-place, or caravanserai&mdash;the New
Bad-Haus of Schlangenbad.</p>

<h2><a name="JOURNEY_TO_MAINZ" id="JOURNEY_TO_MAINZ">JOURNEY TO MAINZ.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> occasion to go to Mainz, I sent overnight to apprise the
ass, Katherinchen, and the groom of her bedchamber, Luy, that I
should require the one to carry, the other to follow me to that
place. Accordingly, when seven o'clock, the hour for my departure,
arrived, on descending the staircase of the great Bad-Haus,
I found Luy in light marching order, leaning against one of the
plane trees in the shrubbery, but no quadruped! In the man&rsquo;s dejected
countenance, it was at once legible that his Katherinchen
neither was nor would be forthcoming; and he had began to ejaculate
a very long-winded lamentation, in which I heard various
times repeated something about sacks of flour and Langen-Schwalbach:
however, Luy&rsquo;s sighs smelt so strongly of rum, that not feeling
as sentimental on the subject as himself, I at once prevailed
upon him to hire for me from a peasant a little long-tailed pony,
which he accordingly very soon brought to the door. The wretched
creature (which for many years had evidently been the property
of a poor man) had been employed for several months in the dryest
of all worldly occupations, namely, in carrying hard stone bottles
to the great brunnen of Nieder-Selters, and had only the evening
before returned home from that uninteresting job. It was evident
she had had alloted to her much more work than food, and as she
stood before me with a drooping head, she shut her eyes as if she
were going to sleep. I at first determined on sending the poor
animal back, but being assured by Luy that, in that case, she would
have much harder work to perform, I reluctantly mounted her,
and at a little jog-trot, which seemed to be her best&mdash;her worst&mdash;in
fact, her only pace, we both, in very humble spirits, placidly proceeded
towards Mainz.</p>

<p>Luy, who besides what he had swallowed, had naturally a great
deal of spirit of his own, by no means, however, liked being left
behind; and though I had formally bidden him adieu, and was
greatly rejoicing that I had done so, yet, while I was ascending
the mountain, happening to look behind me, I saw the fellow
following me at a distance like a wolf. I, therefore, immediately,
pulled at my rein, a hint which the pony most readily
understood, and as soon as Luy came up, I told him very positively
he must return. Seeing that he was detected, he at once gave up
the point; yet the faithful vassal, still having a hankering to perform
for me some little parting service, humbly craved permission to see
if the pony&rsquo;s shoes were, to use the English expression, &ldquo;all right.&rdquo;
The two fore ones were declared by him (with a hiccup) to be
exactly as they should be; but no sooner did he proceed to make
his tipsy reflections on the hind ones, than in one second the pony
seemed by magic to be converted into a mad creature! Luy fell,
as if struck by lightning, to the ground, while the tiny thing, with its
head between its legs (for the rein had been lying loose on its
neck), commenced a series of most violent kicks, which I seriously
thought never would come to an end.</p>

<p>As good luck would have it, I happened, during the operation,
to cleave pretty closely to my saddle, but what thunder-clap had so
suddenly soured the mild disposition of my palfray, I was totally
unable to conceive! It turned out, however, that the poor thing&rsquo;s
paroxysm had been caused by an unholy alliance that had taken
place between the root of her tail and the bowl of Luy&rsquo;s pipe, which,
on his reeling against her, had become firmly entangled in the hair,
and it was because it remained there for about half a minute, burning
her very violently, that she had kicked, or, as a lawyer would
term it, had protested in the violent manner and form I have described.</p>

<p>After I had left Luy, it took some time before the poor frightened
creature could forget the strange mysterious sensation she had experienced;
however, her mind, like her tail, gradually becoming
easy, her head drooped, the rein again hung on her neck, and
in a mile or two we continued to jog on together in as good and
sober fellowship as if no such eccentric calamity had befallen us.</p>

<p>As we were thus ascending the mountain by a narrow path, we
came suddenly to a tree loaded with most beautiful black cherries
evidently dead ripe. The poor idiot of Schlangenbad had escaped
from the hovel in which he had passed so many years of his vacant
existence, and I here found him literally gorging himself with the
fruit. For a moment he stopped short in his meal, wildly rolling
eyes, and looking at me, as if his treacherous, faithless brain could
not clearly tell him whether I was a friend or an enemy: however,
his craving stomach being much more violent than any reflections
the poor creature had power to entertain, he suddenly seemed to
abandon all thought, and again greedily returned to his work. He
was a man about thirty, with features, separately taken, remarkably
handsome: he had fine hazel eyes, and aquiline nose, and a good
mouth; yet there was a horrid twist in the arrangement, in which
not only his features but his whole frame was put together, which,
at a single glance, pointed him out to me as one of those poor
beings who, here and there, are mysteriously sent to make their
appearance on this earth, as if practically to explain to mankind,
and negatively to prove to them, the inestimable blessing of reason,
which is but too often thanklessly enjoyed.</p>

<p>The cherries, which were hanging in immense clusters around us,
were plucked five or six at a time by the poor lame creature before
me, but his thumb and two fore-fingers being apparently paralyzed,
he was obliged to grasp the fruit with his two smallest, and thus,
by a very awkward turn of his elbow, he seemed apparently to be
eating the cherries out of the palm of his hand, which was raised
completely above his head.</p>

<p>Not a cherry did he bite, but, with canine voracity, he continued
to swallow them, stones and all; however, there was evidently a
sharp angle or tender corner in his throat, for I particularly remarked,
that whenever the round fruit passed a certain point, it
caused the idiot&rsquo;s eyes to roll, and a slight convulsion in his frame
continued until the cherry had reached the place of its destination.</p>

<p>The enormous quantity of ripe fruit which I saw this poor creature
swallow in the way I have described quite astonished me;
however, it was useless to attempt to offer him advice, so instead I
gave him what all people like so much better&mdash;a little money&mdash;partly
to enable him to buy himself richer food, and partly because
I wished to see whether he had sense enough to attach any value
to it.</p>

<p>The silver was no sooner in his hand than, putting it most rationally
into the loose pocket of his ragged, coarse cloth trowsers,
he instantly returned to his work with as much avidity as ever.
Seeing that there was to be no end to his meal, I left him hard at
it, and continued to ascend the hill, until the path, suddenly turning
to the right, took me by a level track into the great forest.</p>

<p>The sun had hitherto been very unpleasantly hot, but I was now
sheltered from its rays, while the pure mountain air gave to the
foliage a brightness which in the Schlangenbad woods I had so
often stopped to admire. Although it was midsummer, the old
brown beech leaves of last year still covered the surface of the
ground; yet they were so perfectly dry, that far from there being
anything unhealthy or gloomy in their appearance, they formed a
very beautiful contrast with the bright, clean, polished leaves, as
well as with the white, shining bark of the beech trees, out of which
they had only a year ago sprung into existence. This russet covering
of the ground was, generally speaking, in shade, but every
here and there were bright sparkling patches of sunshine, which,
having penetrated the foliage, shone like gaudy patterns in a dark
carpet.</p>

<p>As the breeze gently stole among the trees, their branches in silence
bowing as it passed them, their brown leaves, being crisp and
dry, occasionally moved;&mdash;occasionally they were more violently
turned over by small fallow deer, which sometimes darted suddenly
across my path, their skin clean as the foliage on which they slept&mdash;their
eye darker than the night, yet brighter than the pure stream
from which they drank.</p>

<p>Enjoying the variety of this placid scene, I took every opportunity,
in search of novelty, to change my track; still, from the position
of the sun, always knowing whereabouts I was, I contrived ultimately
to proceed in the direction I desired, and after having been
for a considerable time completely enveloped in the forest, I suddenly
burst into hot sunshine close to Georgenborn, a little village,
hanging most romantically on the mountain&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>The Rhine, and the immense country beyond it, now flashed upon
my view, and as I trotted along the unassuming street, it was impossible
to help admiring the magnificent prospect which these
humble villagers constantly enjoyed; however, the mind, like the
eye, soon becomes careless of the beauties of creation, and as my
pony jogged onwards in his course, I found that the cottagers looked
upon us both with much greater interest than upon that everlasting
traveller the Rhine. Every woman we met, with great civility
grunted &ldquo;Guten Morgen!&rdquo; as we passed her, while each mountain
peasant seen standing at a door, or even at a window, made
obeisance to us as we crossed his meridian, all people&rsquo;s eyes
following us as far as they could reach.</p>

<p>From Georgenborn, descending a little, we crossed a piece of
table or level land, on which there stood a rock of a very striking
appearance. Where it had come from, Heaven (from whence apparently
it had fallen) probably only knows. As if from the force
with which it had been dropped upon its site, it had split into two
pieces, separated by a yawning crevice, yet small trees or bushes
had grown upon each summit, while the same beech foliage appeared
in the forest which surrounded them.</p>

<p>Passing close beneath this rock, I continued trotting towards the
east for about a league, when gradually descending into a milder
climate, I was hailed by the vineyards which luxuriously surround
the sequestered little village of Frauenstein.</p>

<p>Upon a rock overhanging the hamlet there stood solemnly before
me the remains of the old castle of Frauenstein or Frankenstein,
supposed to have been built in the thirteenth century. In the
year 1300 it was sold to the Archbishop Gerhardt, of Mainz, but
soon afterwards, being ruined by the Emperor Albrecht I., in a tithe
war which he waged against the prelate, it was restored to its original
possessors.</p>

<p>But what more than its castle attracted my attention in the
village of Frauenstein, was an immense plane-tree, the limbs
of which had originally been trained almost horizontally, until,
unable to support their own weight, they were now maintained
by a scaffolding of stout props. Under the parental shadow
of this venerable tree, the children of the village were sitting in
every sort of group and attitude; one or two of their mothers, in
loose, easy dishabille, were spinning, many people were leaning
against the upright scaffolding, and a couple of asses were enjoying
the cool shade of the beautiful foliage, while their drivers were
getting hot and tipsy in a wine-shop, the usual sign of which is in
Germany the branch of a tree affixed to the door-post.</p>

<p>As I had often heard of the celebrated tree of Frauenstein, before
which I now stood, I resolved not to quit it until I had informed
myself of its history, for which I well knew I had only to apply to
the proper authorities: for in Germany, in every little village, there
exists a huge volume either deposited in the church, or in charge
of an officer called the Schuldheisz, in which the history of every
castle, town, or object of importance is carefully preserved. The
young peasant reads it with enthusiastic delight, the old man reflects
upon it with silent pride, and to any traveller, searching for
antiquarian lore, its venerable pages are most liberally opened, and
the simple information they contain generously and gratuitously
bestowed.</p>

<p>On inquiring for the history of this beautiful tree, I was introduced
to a sort of doomsday-book about as large as a church Bible;
and when I compared this volume with a little secluded spot so
totally unknown to the world as the valley or glen of Frauenstein,
I was surprised to find that the autobiography of the latter could
be so bulky,&mdash;in short, that it had so much to say of itself. But it
is the common weakness of man, and particularly, I acknowledge,
of an old man, to fancy that all his thoughts as well as actions are
of vast importance to the world; why therefore should not the
humble Frauenstein be pardoned for an offence which we are all
in the habit of committing?</p>

<p>In this ancient volume, the rigmarole history of the tree was
told with so much eccentric German genius, it displayed such a
graphic description of highborn sentiments and homely life, and
altogether it formed so curious a specimen of the contents of these
strange sentimental village histories, that I procured the following
literal translation, in which the German idiom is faithfully preserved
at the expense of our English phraseology.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Haus-frau&rdquo; (wife) died, and the Count buried the companion
of his days; his daughter was solicited by the most noble of
the land, and because he wished to ingraft this last shoot on a noble
stem, he allowed her to depart, and then solitary and alone he remained
in his fortress. So stands deserted upon the summit of the
mountain, with withered top, an oak!&mdash;moss is its last ornament&mdash;the
storm sports with its last few dry leaves.</p>

<p>A gay circle no longer fills the vaulted chambers of the castle&mdash;no
longer through them does the cheerful goblet&rsquo;s &ldquo;clang&rdquo; resound.
The Count&rsquo;s nightly footsteps echo back to him, and by the
glimmer of the chandeliers the accoutred images of his ancestors
appear to writhe and move on the wall as if they wished to speak
to him. His armour, sullied by the web of the vigilant spider, he
could not look at without sorrowful emotion. Its gentle creaking
against the wall made him shudder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where art thou,&rdquo; he mournfully exclaimed, &ldquo;thou who art
banished? oh my son, wilt thou think of thy father, as he of thee
thinks&mdash;or .... art thou dead? and is that thy flitting spirit which
rustles in my armour, and so feebly moves it? Did I but know
where to find thee, willingly to the world&rsquo;s end would I in repentant
wandering journey&mdash;so heavily it oppresses me, what I have done
to thee;&mdash;I can no longer remain&mdash;forth will I go to the God of
Mercy, in order, before the image of Christ, in the Garden of Olives,
to expiate my sins!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So spoke the aged man&mdash;enveloped his trembling limbs in the
garb of repentance&mdash;took the cockle-hat&mdash;and seized with the right
hand (that formerly was accustomed to the heavy war-sword) the
light long pilgrim&rsquo;s staff. Quietly he stole out of the castle, the
steep path descending, while the porter looked after him astounded,
without demanding &ldquo;Whither?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For many days the old man&rsquo;s feet bore him wide away; at last he
reached a small village, in the middle of which, opposite to a
ruined castle, there stands a very ancient plane-tree. Five arms,
each resembling a stem, bend towards the earth, and almost touch
it. The old men of former times were sitting underneath it, in the
still evening, just as the Count went by; he was greeted by them,
and invited to repose. As he seated himself by their side, &ldquo;You
have a beautiful plane-tree, neighbours,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the oldest of the men, pleased with the praise
bestowed by the pilgrim on the tree, &ldquo;it was nevertheless <em class="smcap">planted
in blood</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; said the Count.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will I also relate,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;Many years ago
there came a young man here, in knightly garb, who had a young
woman with him, beautiful and delicate, but, apparently from their
long journey, worn out. Pale were her cheeks, and her head,
covered with beautiful golden locks, hung upon her conductor&rsquo;s
shoulder. Timidly he looked round&mdash;for, from some reason, he
appeared to fear all men, yet, in compassion for his feeble companion,
he wished to conduct her to some secure hut, where her
tender feet might repose. There, under that ivy-grown tower,
stands a lonely house, belonging to the old lord of the castle;
thither staggered the unhappy man with his dear burden, but scarcely
had he entered the dwelling, than he was seized by the Prince,
with whose niece he was clandestinely eloping. Then was the
noble youth brought bound, and where this plane-tree now spreads
its roots flowed his young blood! The maiden went into a convent;
but before she disappeared, she had this plane-tree planted
on the spot where the blood of her lover flowed: since then it is as
if a spirit life were in the tree that cannot die, and no one likes a
little twig to cut off, or pluck a cluster of blossom, because he fears
it would bleed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s will be done!&rdquo; exclaimed suddenly the old Count, and
departed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is an odd man,&rdquo; said the most venerable of the peasants,
eyeing the stranger who was hastening away; &ldquo;he must have something
that heavily oppresses his soul, for he speaks not, and hastens
away; but, neighbours, the evening draws on apace, and the
evenings in spring are not warm; I think in the white clouds yonder,
towards the Rhine, are still concealed some snow-storms&mdash;let us
come to the warm hearth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The neighbours went their way, while the aged Count, in deep
thought, passed up through the village, at the end of which he
found himself before the churchyard. Terrific black crosses looked
upon the traveller&mdash;the graves were netted over with brambles
and wild roses&mdash;no foot tore asunder the entwinement. On the
right hand of the road there stands a crucifix, hewn with rude art.
From a recess in its pedestal a flame rises towards the bloody feet
of the image, from a lamp nourished by the hand of devotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man of sorrow,&rdquo; thus ascended the prayer of the traveller,
&ldquo;give me my son again&mdash;by thy wounds and sufferings give me
peace&mdash;peace!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke, and turning round towards the mountain, he followed
a narrow path which conducted him to a brook, close under the
flinty, pebbly grape hill. The soft murmurs of its waves rippling
here and there over clear, bright stones harmonized with his deep
devotion. Here the Count found a boy and a girl, who, having
picked flowers, were watching them carried away as they threw
them into the current.</p>

<p>When these children saw the pilgrim&rsquo;s reverend attire, they
arose&mdash;looked up&mdash;seized the old man&rsquo;s hand, and kissed it.
&ldquo;God bless thee, children!&rdquo; said the pilgrim, whom the touch of
their little hands pleased. Seating himself on the ground, he said,
&ldquo;Children, give me to drink out of your pitcher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will find it taste good out of it, stranger-man,&rdquo; said the
little girl; &ldquo;it is our father&rsquo;s pitcher in which we carry him to
drink upon the vine-hill. Look, yonder, he works upon the burning
rocks&mdash;alas! ever since the break of day; our mother often
takes out food to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that your father,&rdquo; said the Count, &ldquo;who with the heavy
pickaxe is tearing up the ground so manfully, as if he would crush
the rocks beneath?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;our father must sweat a good deal before
the mountain will bring forth grapes; but when the vintage
comes, then how gay is the scene!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where does thy father dwell, boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There in the valley beneath, where the white gable end peeps
between the trees: come with us, stranger-man, our mother will
most gladly receive you, for it is her greatest joy when a tired
wanderer calls in upon us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the little girl, &ldquo;then we always have the best
dishes; therefore <i>do</i> come&mdash;I will conduct thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, the little girl seized the old Count&rsquo;s hand, and drew
him forth&mdash;the boy, on the other side, keeping up with them,
sprung backwards and forwards, continually looking kindly at the
stranger, and thus, slowly advancing, they arrived at the hut.</p>

<p>The Haus-frau (wife) was occupied in blowing the light ashes
to awaken a slumbering spark, as the pilgrim entered: at the voices
of her children she looked up, saw the stranger, and raised herself
immediately; advancing towards him with a cheerful countenance,
she said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome, reverend pilgrim, in this poor hut&mdash;if you stand
in need of refreshment after your toilsome pilgrimage, seek it
from us; do not carry the blessing which you bring with you
farther.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, she conducted the old man into the small
but clean room. When he had sat down, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Woman! thou hast pretty and animated children; I wish I
had such a boy as that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said the Haus-frau, &ldquo;he resembles his father&mdash;free
and courageously he often goes alone upon the mountain, and
speaks of castles he will build there. Ah! Sir, if you knew how
heavy that weighs upon my heart!&rdquo;&mdash;(the woman concealed a
tear).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Counsel may here be had,&rdquo; said the Count; &ldquo;I have no son,
and will of yours, if you will give him me, make a knight&mdash;my
castle will some of these days be empty&mdash;no robust son bears my
arms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear mother!&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;if the castle of the aged man
is empty, I can surely, when I am big, go thither?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And leave me here alone?&rdquo; said the mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you will also go!&rdquo; said the boy warmly; &ldquo;How beautiful
is it to look from the height of a castle into the valley beneath!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has a true knightly mind,&rdquo; said the Count; &ldquo;is he born
here in the valley?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prayer and labour,&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;is God&rsquo;s command,
and they are better than all the knightly honours that you can
promise the boy&mdash;he will, like his father, cultivate the vine, and
trust to the blessing of God, who rain and sunshine gives: knights
sit in their castles and know not how much labour, yet how much
blessing and peace can dwell in a poor man&rsquo;s hut! My husband
was oppressed with heavy sorrow; alas! on my account was his
heartfelt grief; but since he found this hut, and works here, he is
much more cheerful than formerly; from the tempest of life he has
entered the harbour of peace&mdash;patiently he bears the heat of the
day, and when I pity him he says, 'Wife, I am indeed now happy;'
yet frequently a troubled thought appears to pierce his soul&mdash;I
watch him narrowly&mdash;a tear then steals down his brown cheeks.
Ah! surely he thinks of the place of his birth&mdash;of a now very aged
grey father&mdash;and whilst I see you, a tear also comes to me&mdash;so is
perhaps now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this minute, the little girl interrupted her, pulled her gently by
the gown, and spoke&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother! come into the kitchen; our father will soon be home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said the mother, leaving the room; &ldquo;in conversation
I forget myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In deep meditation the aged Count sat and thought, &ldquo;Where
may, then, this night my son sleep ....?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly he was roused from his deep melancholy by the lively
boy, who had taken an old hunting-spear from the corner of the
room, and placing himself before the Count, said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See! thus my father kills the wild boar on the mountains&mdash;there
runs one along! My father cries 'Huy!' and immediately
the wild boar throws himself upon the hunter&rsquo;s spear; the spear
sticks deep into the brain! it is hard enough to draw it out!&rdquo; The
boy made actions as if the boar was there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right so, my boy!&rdquo; said the aged man; &ldquo;but does thy father,
then, often hunt upon these mountains?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! that he does, and the neighbours praise him highly, and
call him the valiant extirpator, because he kills the boars which destroy
the corn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the midst of this conversation the father entered; his wife ran
towards him, pressed his sinewy hand, and spoke&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have had again a hot labouring day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;but I find the heavy pickaxe light in hand
when I think of you. God is gracious to the industrious and
honest labourer, and that he feels truly when he has sweated
through a long day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our father is without!&rdquo; cried suddenly the boy; threw the
hunter&rsquo;s spear into the middle of the room, and ran forwards. The
little girl was already hanging at his knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good evening, father,&rdquo; cried the boy, &ldquo;come quick into the
room,&mdash;there sits a stranger-man&mdash;a pilgrim whom I have brought
to you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! there you have done well,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;one must not
allow one tired to pass one&rsquo;s gate without inviting him in. Dear
wife,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;does not labour well reward itself, when one
can receive and refresh a wanderer? Bring us a glass of our best
home-grown wine&mdash;I do not know why I am so gay to-day, and
why I do not experience the slightest fatigue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus spoke the husband&mdash;went into the room&mdash;pressed the hand
of the stranger, and spoke&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome, pious pilgrim! your object is so praiseworthy; a
draught taken with so brave a man must taste doubly good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They sat down opposite to each other in a room half dark&mdash;the
children sat upon their father&rsquo;s knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Relate to us something, father, as usual!&rdquo; said the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That won't do to-day,&rdquo; replied the father; &ldquo;for we have a
guest here&mdash;but what does my hunter&rsquo;s spear do there? have you
been again playing with it? carry it away into the corner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have there,&rdquo; said the pilgrim, &ldquo;a young knight who knows
already how to kill boars&mdash;also you are, I hear, a renowned huntsman
in this valley; therefore you have something of the spirit of a
knight in you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said the vine-labourer, &ldquo;old love rusts not, neither does
the love of arms; so often as I look upon that spear, I wish it were
there for some use ... formerly ... but, aged sir, we will not
think of the past! Wife! bring to the revered&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this minute the Haus-frau entered, placed a jug and goblets
on the table, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May it refresh and do thee good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That it does already,&rdquo; said the pilgrim, &ldquo;presented by so fair
a hand, and with such a friendly countenance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Haus-frau poured out, and the men drank, striking their
glasses with a good clank; the little girl slipped down from her
father&rsquo;s knee, and ran with the mother into the kitchen; the boy
looked wistfully into his father&rsquo;s eyes smilingly, and then towards
the pitcher&mdash;the father understood him, and gave him some wine;
he became more and more lively, and again smiled at the pitcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This boy will never be a peaceful vine-labourer, as I am,&rdquo; said
the father; &ldquo;he has something of the nature of his grandfather in
him: hot and hasty, but in other respects a good-hearted boy&mdash;brave
and honourable... Alas! the remembrance of what is
painful is most apt to assail one by a cheerful glass... If he did
but see thee ... thee ... child of the best and most affectionate
mother&mdash;on thy account he would not any longer be offended
with thy father and mother; thy innocent gambols would rejoice
his old age&mdash;in thee would he see the fire of his youth revive
again&mdash;but...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What dost thou say there?&rdquo; said the pilgrim, stopping him
abruptly; &ldquo;explain that more fully to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I have already said too much, reverend father, but
ascribe it to the wine, which makes one talkative; I will no more
afflict thee with my unfortunate history.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em class="smcap">Speak!</em>&rdquo; said the pilgrim, vehemently and beseechingly; &ldquo;<em class="smcap">Speak!</em>
who art thou?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What connexion hast thou with the world, pious pilgrim, that
you can still trouble yourself about one who has suffered much, and
who has new arrived at the port of peace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em class="smcap">Speak!</em>&rdquo; said the pilgrim; &ldquo;I must know thy history.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;let it be!&mdash;I was not born a vine-labourer&mdash;a
noble stem has engendered me&mdash;but love for a maiden
drove me from my home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love?&rdquo; cried the pilgrim, moved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! I loved a maiden, quite a child of nature, not of greatness&mdash;my
father was displeased&mdash;in a sudden burst of passion he
drove me from him&mdash;wicked relations, who, he being childless,
would inherit, inflamed his wrath against me, and he, whom I yet
honour, and who also surely still cherishes me in his heart&mdash;he...&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pilgrim suddenly rose and went to the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with thee?&rdquo; said the astonished vine-labourer;
&ldquo;has this affected thee too much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy sprang after the aged man, and held him by the hand.
&ldquo;Thou wilt not depart, pilgrim?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>At this minute the Haus-frau entered with a light. At one glance
into the countenance of the vine-labourer, the aged Count exclaimed,
&ldquo;<em class="smcap">My Son!</em>&rdquo; and fell motionless into his arms. As his
senses returned, the father and son recognized each other. Adelaide,
the noble, faithful wife, weeping, held the hands of the aged
man, while the children knelt before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon, father!&rdquo; said the son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grant it to me!&rdquo; replied the pilgrim, &ldquo;and grant to your father
a spot in your quiet harbour of peace, where he may end his days.
Son! thou art of a noble nature, and thy lovely wife is worthy of
thee&mdash;thy children will resemble thee&mdash;no ignoble blood runs in
their veins. Henceforth bear my arms; but, as an honourable remembrance
for posterity, add to them a pilgrim and the pickaxe,
that henceforth no man of high birth may conceive that labour degrades
man&mdash;or despise the peasant who in fact nourishes and protects
the nobleman.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> leaving Frauenstein, which lies low in the range of the Taunus
hills, I found that every trot my pony took introduced me to a
more genial climate and to more luxuriant crops. But vegetation
did not seem alone to rejoice in the change. The human face became
softer and softer as I proceeded, and the stringy, weather-beaten
features of the mountain peasant were changed for countenances
pulpy, fleshy, and evidently better fed. As I continued to
descend, the cows became larger and fatter, the horses higher as
well as stouter, and a few pigs I met had more lard in their composition
than could have been extracted from the whole Langen-Schwalbach
drove, with their old driver, the Schwein-General, to
boot. Jogging onwards, I began at last to fancy that my own mind
was becoming enervated; for several times, after passing well-dressed
people, did I catch myself smoothing with my long staff the
rough, shaggy mane of my pony, or else brushing from my sleeve
some rusty hairs, which a short half-hour ago I should have felt
were just as well sticking upon my coat as on his.</p>

<p>Instead of keen, light mountain air, I now felt myself overpowered
by a burning sun; but, in compensation, Nature displayed
crops which were very luxuriant of their sorts. The following
is a list of those I passed, in merely riding from Frauenstein
to Mainz; it will give some idea of the produce of that highly-favoured
belt, or district, of Nassau (known by the name of the
Rhein-gau) which lies between the bottom of the Taunus hills and
the Rhine:&mdash;</p>

<p>To any one who has been living in secluded retirement, even for
a short time, a visit to a populous city is a dram, causing an excitement
of the mind, too often mistaken for its refreshment. Accordingly,
on my arrival at Mainz, I must own, for a few minutes,
I was gratified with every human being or animal that I met&mdash;at
all the articles displayed in the shops&mdash;and for some time, in mental
delirium, I revelled in the bustling scene before me. However,
having business of some little importance to transact, I had occasion,
more than once, to walk from one part of the town to another,
until getting leg-weary, I began to feel that I was not suited to the
scene before me; in short, that the crutches made by Nature for
declining life, are quietness and retirement; I, therefore, longed to
leave the sun-shiny scene before me, and to ascend once again to
the clouds of Schlangenbad, from which I had so lately fallen.</p>

<p>With this object I had mounted my pony, who, much less sentimental
than myself, would probably most willingly have expended
the remainder of his existence in a city which, in less than three
hours, had miraculously poured into his manger three feeds of
heavy oats, and I was actually on the bridge of boats which crosses
the Rhine, when, finding that the saddle was pressing upon his
withers, I inquired where I could purchase any sort of substance to
place between them, and being directed to a tailor celebrated for
supplying all the government postilions with leather breaches, I
soon succeeded in reaching a door, which corresponded with the
street and number that had been given to me; however, on entering,
I found nothing but a well staircase, pitch dark, with a rope instead
of a hand rail.</p>

<p>At every landing-place, inquiring for the artist I was seeking, I
was always told to go up higher; at last, when I reached the uppermost
stratum of the building, I entered a room which seemed to
be made of yellow leather, for on two sides buckskins were piled
up to the ceiling; leather breeches, trowsers, drawers, gloves, &amp;c.,
were hanging on the other walls, while the great table in the middle
of the room was covered with skinny fragments of all shapes and
sizes. In this new world which I had discovered, the only inhabitants
consisted of a master and his son. The former was a mild
tall man of about fifty, but a human being so very thin, I think, I
never before beheld! He wore neither coat, waistcoat, neckcloth,
nor shirt, but merely an elastic worsted dress (in fact, a Guernsey
frock), which fitted him like his skin, the rest of his lean figure being
concealed by a large, loose, coarse linen apron. The son, who
was about twenty-two, was not bad looking, but &ldquo;<i>talis pater, talis
filius</i>,&rdquo; he was just as thin as his father, and really, though I was
anxious hastily to explain what I wanted, yet my eyes could not
help wandering from father to son, and from son to father, perfectly
unable to determine which was the thinnest; for though one does
not expect to find very much power of body or mind among tailors
of any country (nor indeed do they require it), yet really this pair
of them seemed as if they had not strength enough united to make a
pair of knee breeches for a skeleton.</p>

<p>Having gravely explained the simple object of my visit, I managed
to grope my way down and round, and round and down, the well
staircase, stopping only occasionally to feel my way, and to reflect
with several degrees of pity on the poor thin beings I had left above
me; and even when I got down to my pony (he had been waiting
for me very patiently), I am sure we trotted nearly a couple of
hundred yards before I could shake off the wan, spectre-like appearance
of the old man, or the weak, slight, hectic-looking figure
of the young one; and I finished by sentimentally settling in my own
mind that the father was consumptive&mdash;that the son was a chip from
the same block&mdash;and that they were both galloping, neck and neck,
from their breeches-board to their graves, as hard as they could go.</p>

<p>These reflections were scarcely a quarter of a mile long, when I
discovered that I had left my memorandum-book behind me, and so,
instantly returning, I groped my way to the top of the identical staircase
I had so lately descended. I was there told that the old gentleman
and his son were at dinner, but, determining not to lose my
notes, in I went&mdash;and I cannot describe one-hundredth part of the
feelings which came over me, when I saw the two creatures upon
whom I had wasted so much pity and fine sentiment, for there they
sat before me on their shop-board, with an immense wash-hand
basin, that had been full of common blue Orleans plums, which
they were still munching with extraordinary avidity. A very small
piece of bread was in each of their left hands, but the immense
number of plum-stones on both sides of them betrayed the voracity
with which they had been proceeding with their meal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em class="smcap">Thin!</em>&mdash;no wonder you are <em class="smcap">thin</em>!&rdquo; I muttered to myself; &ldquo;no
wonder that your chests and back bones seem to touch each
other!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Never before had I, among rational beings, witnessed such a
repast, and it really seemed as if nothing could interrupt it, for all
the time I was asking for what I wanted, both father and son were
silently devouring these infernal plums; however, after remounting
my pony, I could not help admitting that the picture was not
without its tiny moral. Two German tailors had been cheerfully
eating a vegetable dinner&mdash;so does the Italian who lives on macaroni;&mdash;so
does the Irish labourer who lives on potatoes;&mdash;so do the
French peasants who eat little but bread;&mdash;so do the millions who
subsist in India on rice&mdash;in Africa on dates&mdash;in the South-Sea
Islands and West Indies on the bread-tree and on yams; in fact,
only a very small proportion of the inhabitants of this globe are
carnivorous: yet, in England, we are so accustomed to the gouty
luxury of meat, that it is now almost looked upon as a necessity;
and though our poor, we must all confess, generally speaking, are
religiously patient, yet so soon as the middle classes are driven
from animal to vegetable diet, they carnivorously both believe and
argue that they are in the world remarkable objects of distress&mdash;that
their country is in distress&mdash;that &ldquo;things cannot last;&rdquo;&mdash;in
short, pointing to an artificial scale of luxury, which they themselves
have hung up in their own minds, or rather in their stomachs, they
persist that vegetable diet is low diet&mdash;that being without roast beef
is living below zero, and that molars, or teeth for grinding the
roots and fruits of the earth, must have been given to mankind in
general, and to the English nation in particular&mdash;by mistake.</p>

<p>After re-crossing the Rhine by the bridge of boats, the sun being
oppressively hot, I joyfully bade adieu to the sultry dry city and
garrison of Mainz. As I gradually ascended towards my home, I
found the air becoming cooler and fresher, the herbage greener,
and greener, the foliage of the beech-trees brighter and cleaner;
everything in the valley seemed in peaceful silence to be welcoming
my return; and when I came actually in sight of the hermitage of
Schlangenbad, I could not help muttering to myself, &ldquo;Hard features&mdash;hard
life&mdash;lean pigs, and lovely nature, for ever!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="EXCURSION_TO_THE_NIEDERWALD" id="EXCURSION_TO_THE_NIEDERWALD">EXCURSION TO THE NIEDERWALD.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Wishing</span> to see Rudesheim and its neighbourhood, I one morning
left Schlangenbad very early, in a hired open carriage, drawn by a
pair of small punchy horses.</p>

<p>We were to get first to the Rhine at the village of Ellfeld, and we
accordingly proceeded about a league on the great macadamized
road towards Mainz, when, turning to the right, we passed under
the celebrated hill of Rauenthal, and then very shortly came in sight
of the retired peaceful little village of Neudorf. The simple outline
of this remote hamlet, as well as the costume and attitudes of a
row of peasants, who, seated on a grassy bank at the road side,
were resting from their labour, formed the subject of an interesting
sketch which the Paneidolon presented to me in a very few
minutes.</p>

<p>This exceedingly clever, newly-invented instrument, the most
silent&mdash;the most faithful, and one of the most entertaining <i>compagnons
de voyage</i> which any traveller can desire, consists of a
small box, in which can be packed anything it is capable of holding.
On being emptied for use, all that is necessary is to put one&rsquo;s head
into one side, and then trace with a pencil the objects which are instantly
seen most beautifully delineated at the other.</p>

<p>Whether the perspective be complicated or simple&mdash;whether the
figures be human or inhuman, it is all the same, for they are traced
with equal facility, rain not even retarding the operation. The Paneidolon
also possesses an advantage which all very modest people
will, I think, appreciate, for the operator&rsquo;s face being (like Jack&rsquo;s)
&ldquo;in a box,&rdquo; no person can stare at it or the drawing; whereas,
while sketching with the camera lucida, everybody must have observed
that the village peasants, in crowds, not only watch every
line of the pencil, but laugh outright at the contortion of countenance
with which the poor Syntax, in search of the picturesque,
having one optic closed, squints with the other through a hole
scarcely bigger than the head of a pin, standing all the time in the
inquisitive attitude of a young magpie looking into a marrow-bone.</p>

<p>On leaving Neudorf, getting into a cross country road, or <i>chemin
de terre</i>, we began, with the carriage-wheel dragged, an uninterrupted
descent, which was to lead us to the banks of the Rhine.
The horses (which had no blinkers) having neither to pull nor to
hold back, were trotting merrily along, occasionally looking at me&mdash;occasionally
biting at each other; every thing was delightful, save
and except a whiff of tobacco, which, about six times a minute, like
a sort of pulsation, proved that my torpid driver was not really, as
he appeared to be&mdash;a corpse; when, all of a sudden, as we were
jolting down a narrow ravine, surmounted by vineyards, I saw, about
a hundred yards before us, a cart heavily laden, drawn by two little
cows. There happened at the moment to be a small road at right
angles on our left, into which we ought to have turned to let our
opponent pass: but either the driver did not see, or would not see,
the humble vehicle, and so onwards he recklessly drove, until our
horses&rsquo; heads and the cows&rsquo; horns being nearly close together, the
dull, heavy lord of the creation pulled at his reins and stopped.</p>

<p>The road was so narrow, and the banks of the ravine so precipitous,
that there was scarcely room on either side of the vehicle for
a human being to pass; and the cows and horses being vis-à-vis, or
&ldquo;at issue,&rdquo; the legal question now arose which of the two carriages
was to retrograde.</p>

<p>As, without metaphor, I sat on my woolsack, or cushion stuffed
with wool, my first judgement was, that the odds were not in favour
of the defendant, the poor old woman,&mdash;for she had not only to
contend with the plaintiff (my stupid driver), his yellow carriage,
and two bay horses, but the hill itself was sadly against her; her
opponent loudly exclaiming that she and her cows could retire
easier than he could. The toothless old woman did not attempt to
plead for herself; but what was infinitely better, having first proved,
by pushing at her cows&rsquo; heads with all her force, that they actually
did not know how to back, she showed us her face, which had every
appearance of going to sleep. Seeing affairs in this state, I got out
of the carriage, and quietly walked on: however, I afterwards
learnt, with great pleasure, that the old woman gained her cause,
and that the squabble ended by the yellow carriage retreating to the
point where its stupid, inanimate driver ought to have stopped it.</p>

<p>On arriving at the bottom of the lane, we reached that noble
road, running parallel with and close to the Rhine, which was
brought into its present excellent state in the time of Napoleon.
Along it, with considerable noise, we trotted steadily, stopping only
about once every half hour to pay a few kreuzers at what was called
the <i>Barrière</i>. No barrier, however, existed, their being nothing
to mark the fatal spot but an inanimate, party-coloured post, exhibiting,
in stripes of blue and orange, the government colours of
Nassau.</p>

<p>On the horses stopping, which they seemed most loyally to do of
their own accord, the person whose office it was to collect this
road-money, or <i>chaussée-gelt</i>, in process of time, appeared at a
window with a heavy pipe hanging in his mouth, and in his hand
an immense long stick, to the end of which there was affixed a
small box containing a ticket, in exchange for which I silently
dropped my money into this till. Not a word was spoken, but,
with the gravity of an angler, the man having drawn in his rod, a
whiff of tobacco was vomited from his mouth, and then the window,
like the transaction&mdash;closed.</p>

<p>After proceeding for some hours, having passed through Erbach
and Hattenheim, we drove through the village of Johannisberg, which
lies crouching at the foot of the hill so remarkable on the Rhine for
being crowned with the white, shining habitation of Prince Metternich.
The celebrated vineyards on this estate were swarming
with labourers, male and female, who were seen busily lopping off
the exuberant heads of the vines, an operation which, with arms
lifted above their heads, was not inelegantly performed with a
common sickle.</p>

<p>The Rhine had now assumed the appearance of a lake, for
which, at this spot, it is so remarkable, and Rudesheim, to which I
was proceeding, appeared to be situated at its extremity, the chasm
which the river has there burst for itself through the lofty range of
the Taunus mountains not being perceptible.</p>

<p>On arriving at Rudesheim, I most joyfully extricated myself from
the carriage, and instantly hiring a guide and a mule, I contentedly
told the former to drive me before him to whatever point in his
neighbourhood was generally considered to be the best worth
seeing; and perfectly unconscious where he would propel me, the
man began to beat the mule&mdash;the mule began to trot along&mdash;and,
little black memorandum-book in hand, I began to make my notes.</p>

<p>After ascending a very narrow path, which passed through
vineyards, the sun, as I became exposed to it, feeling hotter and
hotter, I entered a wild, low, stunted, plantation of oak shrubs,
which was soon exchanged for a noble wood of oak and beech
trees, between which I had room enough to ride in any direction.</p>

<p>The shade was exceedingly agreeable; the view, however, was
totally concealed, until I suddenly came to a projecting point, on
which there was a small temple, commanding a most splendid
prospect.</p>

<p>After resting here for a few minutes, my mule and his burden
again entered the forest; and, continuing to ascend to a considerable
height, we both at last approached a large stone building like a
barrack, part of which was in ruins; and no sooner had we reached
its southern extremity, than my guide, with a look of vast importance,
arrested the progress of the beast. As I beheld nothing at
all worth the jolting I had had in the carriage, I felt most grievously
disappointed; and though I had no one&rsquo;s bad taste to accuse but my
own, in having committed myself to the barbarous biped who stood
before me, yet I felt, if possible, still more out of sorts at the fellow
desiring me to halloo as loud as I could, he informing me, with a
look of indescribable self-satisfaction, that as soon as I should do
so, an echo would repeat all my exclamations three times!!!</p>

<p>The man seeing that I did not at all enjoy his noisy miracle,
made a sign to me to follow him, and he accordingly led me to what
appeared to my eyes to be nothing but a large heap of stones, held
together by brambles. At one side, however, of this confused
mass, there appeared to be a hole which looked very much as if it
had been intended as an ice-house: however, on entering it, I found
it to be a long, dark, subterranean passage, cut out of the solid
rock; and here, groping my way, I followed my guide, until, coming
to a wooden partition or door, he opened it, when, to my great
astonishment and delight, I found myself in an octagonal chamber,
most deservedly called <i>Bezauberte Höhle</i>&mdash;the enchanted cave!</p>

<p>It was a cavern or cavity in the rock, with three fissures or embrasures
radiating at a small angle; yet each looking down upon
the Rhine, which, pent within its narrow rocky channel, was, at a
great depth, struggling immediately beneath us. The sudden burst
into daylight, and the brightness of the gay, sunshiny scenes which
through the three rude windows had come so suddenly to view (for
I really did not know that I was on the brink of the precipice of the
Rhine), was exceedingly enchanting, and I was most fully enjoying
it as well as the reflection, that there was no one to interrupt me
when I suddenly fancied that I certainly heard, somewhere or other
within the bowels of the living rock in which I was embedded, a
faint sound, like the melody of female voices, which, in marked
measure, seemed to swell stronger, until I decidedly and plainly
heard them, in full chorus, chanting the following well-known national
air of this country:&mdash;(<i>See &ldquo;the Schlangenbader Volkslied,&rdquo;
National Air of Schlangenbad, at the end of the volume.</i>)</p>

<p>From time to time the earthly or unearthly sounds died away,&mdash;lost
in the intricate turns of the subterraneous passage;&mdash;at last,
they were heard as if craving permission to enter, and my guide
running to the wooden door, no sooner threw it wide open, than the
music at once rushing in like a flood, filled the vaulted chamber in
which I stood, and in a few seconds, to my very great surprise,
there, marched in, two by two, a youthful bridal party! The
heads of eight or ten young girls (following a bride and a bridegroom)
were ornamented with wreaths of bright green leaves,
which formed a pleasing contrast with their brown hair of various
shades, and most particularly with the raven-black tresses of the
bride, which were plaited round her pleasing, modest-looking face
very gracefully.</p>

<p>The whole party (the bridegroom, the only representative of his
sex, of course included) had left Mainz that morning, to spend a
happy day in the magic cave; and, certainly, their unexpected appearance
gave a fairy enchantment to the scene.</p>

<p>After continuing their patriotic song for some time, suddenly
letting go each other&rsquo;s hands, they flew to three fissures or windows
in the rock, and I heard them, with great emphasis, point out to
each other Bingenloch, Rheinstein, and other romantic points
equally celebrated for their beauty. These youthful people then
minutely scanned over the interior of the vaulted grave in which we
were all so delightfully buried alive; at last, so like young travellers,
they all felt an irresistible desire to scrawl their names upon the
wall; and, seeing an old man reclining in one corner of the chamber,
with about an inch of pencil in his lean, withered hand, the bride,
bowing with pleasing modesty and diffidence, asked me to lend it
to her.</p>

<p>Her name, and that of her partner, were accordingly inscribed;
and others would, with equal bursts of joy, have been added to the
list, but observing that my poor pencil, which would still have lived
in my service many a year, and which, in fact, was all I had, was,
from its violent rencontres with the hard, gritty wall, actually gasping
for life in the illiterate clutches of a great bony bridesmaid, I
very civilly managed, under pretence of cutting it, to extract it from
her grasp; and the attention of the youthful party flitting of its own
accord to some other object, the stump of my poor crayon was
miraculously spared to continue its humble notes of the day&rsquo;s
proceedings.</p>

<p>On leaving the enchanted cave, we ascended through a noble
oak wood, until reaching a most celebrated pinnacle of the Taunus
mountains, we arrived at the <em class="smcap">Rossel</em>, an old ruined castle, which,
standing on the Niederwald like a weather-beaten sentinel at his
post, seemed to be faithfully guarding the entrance of that strange
mysterious chasm, through which, at an immense depth beneath,
the river was triumphantly and majestically flowing.</p>

<p>Although the view from the ruined top of this castle was very extensive
and magnificent, yet the dark, struggling river was so remarkable
an object, that it at first completely engrossed my attention.
While the great mass of water was flowing on its course, a sort of
civil war was raging between various particles of the element. In
some places an eddy seemed to be rebelliously trying to stem the
stream; in others the water was revolving in a circle;&mdash;here it was
seen tumbling and breaking over a sunken rock&mdash;there as smooth
as glass. In the middle of these fractious scenes, there lay, as it
were, calmly at anchor, two or three islands, covered with poplars
and willows, upon one of which stood the ruins of the <i>Mäusethurm</i>,
or tower of that stingy Bishop of Mainz, famous, or rather infamous,
in the history of the Rhine, for having been gnawed to death by
rats. On the opposite side of the river were to be seen the <i>Rochus
Capelle</i>, a tower built to commemorate the cessation of the plague,
the beautiful castle of Rheinstein, the residence of Prince Frederick
of Prussia, the blue-slated town of Bingen, with its bridge crossing
the Nahe, which, running at right angles, here delivers up its
waters to the Rhine.</p>

<p>The difference in caste or colour between the two rivers at their
point of meeting is very remarkable, the Rhine, being clear and
green, the Nahe a deep muddy brown; however, they no sooner
enter the chasm in the Taunus hills than the distinction is annihilated
in the violent hubble-bubble commotions which ensue.</p>

<p>The view beyond these home objects now attracted my attention.
The Prussian hills opposite were richly clothed with wood, while
on their left lay prostrate the province of Darmstadt, a large brown
flat space, studded, as far as the eye could reach, with villages,
which, though distinctly remarkable in the foreground, were yet
scarcely perceptible in the perspective. Behind my back was the
duchy of Nassau, with several old ruined castles perched on the
pinnacles of the wood-covered hills of the Niederwald.</p>

<p>During the whole time that I was placidly enjoying this beautiful
picture around and beneath me, the bridal party of young people,
equally happy in their way, were singing, laughing, or waltzing;
and their cheerful accents, echoing from one old ruin to another,
seemed for the moment to restore to these deserted walls that joy
to which they had so long been a stranger.</p>

<p>Having at last mounted my mule, I attempted to bid my companions
farewell; however, they insisted on accompanying me and
my guide through the forest, singing their national airs in chorus
as they went. Their footsteps kept pace with their tunes, and as
they advanced, their young voices thrilled among the trees with
great effect; sometimes the wild melody, like a stop-waltz, suddenly
ceased, and they proceeded several paces in silence; then,
again, it as unexpectedly burst upon the ear,&mdash;in short, like the
children of all German schools, they had evidently been taught
time and the complete management of their voices, a natural and
pleasing accomplishment, which can scarcely be sufficiently admired.</p>

<p>From these young people themselves I did not attempt to extract
their little history; but I learnt from my guide in a whisper (for
which I thought there was no great occasion), that the young
couple who hand in hand before me were leading the procession
through the wood, were <em class="smcap">verlobt</em> (affianced), that is to say, they
were under sentence eventually to be married.</p>

<p>This quiet, jog-trot, half-and-half connubial arrangement is
very common indeed all over Germany; and no sooner is it settled
and approved of, than the young people are permitted to associate
together at almost all times, notwithstanding it is often decreed to
be prudent that many years should elapse before their marriage
can possibly take place; in short, they are constantly obliged to wait
until either their income rises sufficiently, or until butter, meat,
bread, coffee, and tobacco, sufficiently fall.</p>

<p>As seated on my mule I followed these steady, well-behaved,
and apparently well-educated young people through the forest, listening
to their cheerful choruses, I could not, during one short interval
of silence, help reflecting how differently such unions are
managed in different countries on the globe.</p>

<p>A quarter of a century has nearly elapsed since I chanced to be
crossing from the island of Salamis to Athens, with a young Athenian
of rank, who was also, in his way, &ldquo;affianced.&rdquo; We spent, I remember,
the night together in an open boat, and certainly never
did I before or since witness the aching of a lad&rsquo;s heart produce
effects so closely resembling the aching of his stomach. My friend
lay at the bottom of the trabacolo absolutely groaning with love;
his moans were piteous beyond description, and nothing seemed
to afford his affliction any relief but the following stanza, which
over and over again he continued most romantically singing to the
moon:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Quando la notte viene,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Non ho riposo, o Nice;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Son misero e infelice<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Esser lontan da te!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>On his arrival at Athens he earnestly entreated me to call for
him on the object of his affection, for he himself, by the custom of
his country, was not allowed to see her, precisely from the same
reason which permitted the young German couple to stroll together
through the lonely, lovely forest of the Niederwald, namely&mdash;because
they were &ldquo;<i>verlobt</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bridal party now separated themselves from my guide, his
mule, and myself, they, waving their handkerchiefs to us, descending
a path on the right; we continuing the old track, which led us
at last to Rudesheim.</p>

<p>As soon as the horses could be put to my carriage, it being quite
late, I set out, by moonlight, to return. Vineyards, orchards, and
harvest were now veiled from my view, but the castle of Prince
Metternich&mdash;the solitary tower of Scharfenstein, and the dark
range of the Taunus mountains had assumed a strange, obscure,
and supernatural appearance, magnificently contrasted with the
long bright, serpentine course of the Rhine, which, shining from
Ringen to Mainz, glided joyfully along, as if it knew it had attracted
to itself the light which the landscape had lost.</p>

<p>On leaving the great chaussée, which runs along the banks of
the river, like the towing-path of a canal, we ascended the cross
road, down which we had trundled so merrily in the morning, and
without meeting cows, carts, toothless old women, or any other
obstruction, I reached about midnight the Bad-Haus of Schlangenbad.
On ascending the staircase, I found that the two little
lamps in the passage had expired; however, the key of my apartments
was in my pocket, the moon was shining through the window
upon my table, and so before one short hour had elapsed, Rudesheim&mdash;the
niggardly Bishop of Mainz, with his tower and rats&mdash;the
bridal party&mdash;the enchanted cave&mdash;the lofty Rossel, and the
magnificent range of the Niederwald, were all tumbling head over
heels in my mind, while I lay as it were quietly beneath them&mdash;asleep.</p>

<h2><a name="WIESBADEN" id="WIESBADEN">WIESBADEN.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> day at last arrived for my departure from the green, happy
little valley of Schlangenbad. Whether or not its viper baths
really possess the effect ascribed to them, of tranquillizing the
nerves, I will not presume to declare; but that the loneliness and
loveliness of the place can fascinate, as well as tranquillize, the
mind, I believe as firmly, as I know that the Schlangenbad water
rubs from the body the red rust of Langen-Schwalbach.</p>

<p>Those who, on the tiny surface of this little world, please
themselves with playing what they call &ldquo;the great game of life,&rdquo;
would of course abhor a spot in which they could neither be envied
nor admired; but to any grovelling-minded person, who thinks
himself happy when he is quiet and clean, I can humbly recommend
this valley, as a retreat exquisitely suited to his taste.</p>

<p>After casting a farewell glance round apartments to which I felt
myself most unaccountably attached, descending the long staircase
of the New Bad-Haus, I walked across the shrubbery to my carriage,
around which had assembled a few people, who, I was very
much surprised to find, were witnessing my departure with regret!</p>

<p>Luy, who had followed my (I mean Katherinchen&rsquo;s) footsteps
so many a weary hour, strange as it may sound (and so contrary
to what the ass must have felt), was evidently sorry I was going.
The old &ldquo;Bad&rdquo; man&rsquo;s countenance looked as serious and as
wrinkled on the subject as the throat of his toad&mdash;his wan, sallow-faced
Jezebel of a wife stood before the carriage steps waving her
lean hand in sorrow, and the young maid of the Bad-Haus, who
had made my bed, merely because I had troubled her for a longer
period than any other visiter, actually began to shed some tears.
The whole group begged permission to kiss my hand; and there
was so much kind feeling evinced, that I felt quite relieved when I
found that the postilion and his horses had spoiled the picture, in
short, that we were trotting and trumpeting along the broad road
which leads to Wiesbaden.</p>

<p>As I had determined on visiting the Duke of Nassau&rsquo;s hunting-seat
&ldquo;Die Platte&rdquo; in my way to Wiesbaden, after proceeding about
four miles, I left the carriage in the high road, and walking through
the woods towards my object, I passed several very large plantations
of fir-trees which had been so unusually thick that they were
completely impervious, even to a wild boar; for, not only were the
trees themselves merely a few inches asunder, but their branches,
which feathered to the ground, interlaced one with another until
they formed altogether an impenetrable jungle. Through this mass
of vegetation, narrow paths about three feet broad were cut in various
directions to enable the deer to traverse the country.</p>

<p>In passing through the beech forest, I observed that the roads or
cuts were often as much as forty or fifty feet in breadth, and every
here and there the boughs and foliage were artificially entwined in
a very ingenious manner, leaving small loop-holes through which
the Duke, his visiters, or his huntsmen, might shoot at the game as
they wildly darted by. A single one of these verdant batteries might
possibly be observed and avoided by the cautious, deep-searching
eye of the deer, but they exist all over the woods in such numbers,
that the animals, accustomed to them from their birth, can fear
nothing from them, until the fatal moment arrives, when their experience,
so dearly bought, arrives too late.</p>

<p>After advancing for about an hour through these green streets,
I came suddenly upon the Duke&rsquo;s hunting-seat, the Platte, a plain
white stone, cubic building, which, as if disdaining gardens, flowerbeds,
or any artificial embellishment, stands alone, on a prominent
edge of the Taunus hills, looking down upon Wiesbaden, Mainz,
Frankfort, and over the immense flat, continental-looking country
which I have already described. Its situation is very striking, and
though of course it is dreadfully exposed to the winter&rsquo;s blast, yet,
as a sporting residence, during the summer or autumn months,
nothing I think can surpass the beauty and unrestrained magnificence
of its view.</p>

<p>Before the entrance door, in attitudes of great freedom, there
are two immense bronze statues of stags, most beautifully executed,
and on entering the apartments, which are lofty and grand, every
article of furniture, as well as every ornament, is ingeniously composed
of pieces, larger or smaller, of buck-horn. Immense antlers,
one above another, are ranged in the hall, as well as on the walls
of the great staircase; and certainly when a sportsman comes to
the Platte on a visit to the Duke of Nassau, everything his eyes can
rest on, not only reminds him of his favourite pursuit, but seems
also to promise him as much of it as the keenest hunter can desire:
in short, without the slightest pretension, the Platte is nobly adapted
to its purpose, and with great liberality it is open at almost all times
to the inspection of &ldquo;gentlemen sportsmen&rdquo; and travellers from all
quarters of the globe. About twelve hundred feet beneath it, in a
comparatively flat country, bounded on two sides by the Rhine
and the Main, lies <em class="smcap">Wiesbaden</em>, the capital of the duchy of Nassau,
the present seat of its government, and the spot by far the most
numerously attended as a watering-place.</p>

<p>Looking down upon it from the Platte, this town or city is apparently
about three-quarters of an English mile square, one
quarter of this area being covered with a rubbishy old, the remainder
with a staring formal new town, composed of streets of
white stone houses, running at right angles to each other. As I
first approached it, it appeared to me to be as hot, as formal, and
as uninteresting a place as I ever beheld: however, as soon as I
entered it, I very soon found out that its inhabitants and indeed its
visiters entertain a very different opinion of the place, they pronouncing
it to be one of the most fashionable, and consequently
most agreeable, watering-places in all Germany.</p>

<p>In searching for a lodging, I at once went to most of the principal
hotels, several of which I found to be grievously afflicted with
smells, which (though I most politely bowed to every person I
met in the passage) it did not at all suit me to encounter. At one
place, as an excuse for not taking the unsavoury suite of apartments
which were offered to me, I ventured quietly to remark, that they
were very much dearer than those I had just left. The master at
once admitted the fact, but craning himself up into the proudest
attitude his large stomach would admit of, he observed&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Mais&mdash;Monsieur!
savez-vous que vous aurez à Wiesbaden plus d'amusement
dans une heure, que vous n'auriez à Schlangenbad dans
un an?...</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the horrid atmosphere in which I stood, I had no inclination
to argue on happiness or any subject; so hastening into the open
air, I continued my search, until finding, the landlord at the Englischen
Hof civil, and exceedingly anxious to humour all my old-fashioned
English whims and oddities, I accepted the rooms he offered
me, and thus for a few days dropped my anchor in the capital
of the duchy of Nassau.</p>

<p>About twelve thousand strangers are supposed annually to visit
this gay watering-place, and consequently, to pen up all this
fashionable flock within the limits of so small a town, requires no
little ramming, cramming, and good arrangement. The dinner
hour, or time of the tables-d'hôte, as at Langen Schwalbach,
Schlangenbad, and indeed all other places in Germany, was one
o'clock, and the crowds of hungry people who at that hour, following
their appetites, were in different directions seen slowly but resolutely
advancing to their food, was very remarkable. Voluntarily
enlisting into one of these marching regiments, I allowed myself to
be carried along with it, I knew not where, until I found myself,
with an empty stomach and a napkin on my knees, quietly seated at
one of three immense long tables, in a room with above 250 people,
all secretly as hungry as myself.</p>

<p>The quantity of food and attention bestowed upon me for one
florin filled me with astonishment; &ldquo;and certainly,&rdquo; said I to myself,
&ldquo;a man may travel very far indeed, before he will find
provisions and civility cheaper than in the duchy of Nassau!&rdquo; The
meat alone which was offered to me, if it had been thrown at my
head raw, would have been not only a most excellent bargain, but
much more than any one could possibly have expected for the money;
but when it was presented to me, cooked up with sauces of
various flavours, attended with omelettes, fruits, tarts, puddings,
preserves, fish, &amp;c. &amp;c., and served with a quantity of politeness
and civility which seemed to be infinite, I own I felt that in the
scene around me there existed quite as much refreshment and food
for the mind as for the body.</p>

<p>It is seldom or ever that I pay the slightest attention to dinner
conversation, the dishes, ninety-nine times out of a hundred, being,
in my opinion, so very much better; however, much against my
will, I overheard some people talking of a duel, which I will mention,
hoping it may tend to show by what disgusting, fiend-like sentiments
this practice can be disgraced.</p>

<p>A couple of Germans, having quarrelled about some beautiful
lady, met with sabres in their hands to fight a duel. The ugly one,
who was of course the most violent of the two, after many attempts
to deprive his hated adversary, of his life, at last aimed a desperate
blow at his head, which, though it missed its object, yet fell upon,
and actually cut off, the good-looking man&rsquo;s nose. It had scarcely
reached the ground, when its owner, feeling that his beauty was
gone, instantly threw away his sword, and with both arms extended,
eagerly bent forward with the intention to pick up his own
property and replace it; but the ugly German no sooner observed
the intention, than, darting forwards with the malice of the devil
himself, he jumped upon the nose, and before its master&rsquo;s face
crushed it and ground it to atoms!</p>

<p>In strolling very slowly about the town, after dinner, the first
object which aroused my curiosity was a steam I observed rising
through the iron gratings, which at the corners of the streets, covered
the main drains or common sewers of the town. At first I
thought it proceeded from washerwomen, pig-scalders, or some
such artificial cause; but I no sooner reached the great Koch-brunnen
(boiling spring), than I learnt it was the natural temperature
of the Wiesbaden waters that had thus attracted my attention.</p>

<p>As I stood before this immense cauldron, with eyes staring at the
volume of steam which was arising from it, and with ears listening
to a civil person who was voluntarily explaining to me that there
were fifteen other springs in the town, their temperature being at all
times of the year about 140° of Fahrenheit, I could not help feeling
a sort of unpleasant sensation, similar to what I had experienced on
the edges of Etna and Vesuvius; in short, I had been so little accustomed
to live in a town heated by subterranean fire, that it just
crossed my mind, whether, in case the engineer below, from laziness,
should put on too many coals at once, or from carelessness
should neglect to keep open his proper valves, an explosion might
not take place, which would suddenly send me, Koch-brunnen,
Wiesbaden, and Co., on a shooting excursion to the Duke&rsquo;s lofty
hunting-seat, the Platte. The ground in the vicinity of these springs
is so warm that in winter the snow does not remain upon it; and
formerly, when these waters used to flow from the town into a
small lake, from not freezing, it became in hard weather the resort
of birds of all descriptions: indeed, even now, they say that that
part of the Rhine into which the Wiesbaden waters eventually flow,
is observed to be always remarkably free from ice.</p>

<p>Wiesbaden, inhabited by people called Mattiaci, was not only
known to the Romans, but fortified by the twenty-second legion,
who also built baths, the remains of which exist to the present
day. Even in such remote ages, it was observed that these
waters retained their heat longer than common water, or salt water,
of the same specific gravity, heated to the same degree; indeed,
Pliny remarked&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Sunt et Mattiaci in Germania fontes calidi,
quorum haustus triduo fervet.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The town of Wiesbaden is evidently one which does not appreciate
the luxury of &ldquo;home, sweet home;&rdquo; for it is built, not for
itself, but for strangers; and though most people loudly admire the
size of the buildings, yet, to my mind, there is something very melancholy
in seeing houses so much too fine for the style of inhabitants
to whom they belong. A city of lodging-houses, like an army
of mercenaries, may to each individual be a profitable speculation,
but no brilliant uniform, or external show, can secretly compensate
for the want of national self-pride which glows in the heart of a
soldier, standing under his country&rsquo;s colours, or in the mind of a
man living consistently in his own little home.</p>

<p>About twenty years ago, the inhabitants of Wiesbaden were pent
up in narrow, dirty streets, surrounded by swampy ditches and an
old Roman wall. A complete new town has since been erected,
and accommodation has thus been afforded for upwards of 12,000
strangers, the population of the place, men, women, and children
included, scarcely amounting to 8000 souls.</p>

<p>During the gay season, of course all is bustle and delight; but I
can conceive nothing less cheerful than such a place must become,
when all its motley visiters having flown away, winter begins to
look it in the face; however, certainly the inhabitants of Wiesbaden
do not seem to view the subject at all in this point of view, for they
all talk with great pride of their fine new town, and strut about
their large houses like children wearing men&rsquo;s shoes ten times too
big for their feet.</p>

<p>The most striking object at Wiesbaden is a large square, bounded
on one side by a handsome theatre, on two others by a colonnade
of shops, and on a third by a very handsome building called the
Cursaal, an edifice 430 feet in length, having, in front, a portico
supported by six Ionic columns, above which there is inscribed, in
gold letters&mdash;</p>

<p class="center some-space-above">
FONTIBUS MATTIACIS, MDCCCX.<br />
</p>

<p>On entering the great door, I found myself at once in a saloon,
or ball-room, 130 feet in length, 60 in breadth, and 50 in height, in
which there is a gallery supported by 32 marble pillars of the
Corinthian order; lustres are suspended from the ceiling, and, in
niches in the wall, there are twelve white marble statues, which
were originally intended for Letitia Bonaparte, and which the
Wiesbaden people extol by saying that they cost about 1200<i>l.</i></p>

<p>Branching from this great assembly-room, there are several
smaller apartments, which in England would be called hells, or
gambling-rooms.</p>

<p>The back of the Cursaal looks into a sort of parade, upon which,
after dinner, hundreds of visiters sit in groups, to drink cheap coffee,
listen to a band of most excellent cheap music, and admire,
instead of swans, an immense number of snail-gobbling ducks and
ducklings, which, swimming about a pond, shaded by weeping willows
and acacias, come when they are called, and, ducklike, of
course eat whatever is thrown to them.</p>

<p>Beyond this pond, which is within fifty yards of the Cursaal,
there is a nice shrubbery, particularly pleasing to the stranger from
the reflection, that at very great trouble, and at considerable expense,
it has been planted, furnished with benches, and tastefully
adorned by the inhabitants of Wiesbaden, for the gratification of
their guests. From it a long shady walk, running by the side of a
stream of water, extends for about two miles, to the ruins of the
castle of Sonneburg.</p>

<p>Among the buildings of Wiesbaden, the principal ones, after the
Cursaal and theatre, are the Schlosschen, containing a public library
and museum, the hotels of the Four Seasons, the Eagle, the Rose,
the Schutzenhof, and the Englischen Hof.</p>

<p>The churches are small, and seem adapted in size to the old,
rather than to the new town. By far the greatest proportion of the
inhabitants are Protestants, and their place of worship is scarcely
big enough to hold them. At the southern extremity of the town
there exists a huge pile of rubbish, with several high modern walls
in ruins.</p>

<p>It appears that, a few years ago, the Catholics at Wiesbaden determined
on building a church, which was to vie in magnificence
with the Cursaal, and other gaudy specimens of the new town.</p>

<p>Eighty thousand florins were accordingly raised by subscription,
and the huge edifice was actually finished, the priests were shaved,
and everything was ready for the celebration of mass, when, à propos
to nothing, &ldquo;<i>occidit una domus!</i>&rdquo; down it came thundering to
the ground!</p>

<p>Whether it was blown up by subterranean heat, or burst by the
action of frost,&mdash;whether it was the foundation, or the fine arched
roof which gave way, are points which at Wiesbaden are still argued
with acrimony and eagerness; and, to this day, men&rsquo;s mouths are
seen quite full of jagged consonants, as they condemn or defend
the architect of the building&mdash;poor, unfortunate Mr. Schrumpf!</p>

<p>After having made myself acquainted with the geography of Wiesbaden,
I arose one morning at half-past five o'clock to see the visiters
drinking the waters. The scene was really an odd one. The long parade,
at one extremity of which stood smoking and fuming the great
Koch-brunnen, was seen crowded with respectably-dressed people,
of both sexes, all walking (like so many watchmen, carrying lanterns),
with glasses in their hands, filled, half filled, or quarter filled,
with the medicine, which had been delivered to them from the
brunnen so scalding hot, that they dared not even sip it, as they
walked, until they had carried it for a considerable time.</p>

<p>It requires no little dexterity to advance in this way, without
spilling one&rsquo;s medicine, to say nothing of burning or slopping it over
one&rsquo;s fellow patients. Every person&rsquo;s eye, therefore, whatever
might be the theme of his conversation, was instantly fixed upon his
glass; some few carried the thing along with elegance, but I could
not help remarking that the greater proportion of people walked
with their backs up, and were evidently very little at their ease.
A band of Wind-instruments was playing, and an author, a native of
Wiesbaden, in describing this scene, has sentimentally exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Thousands
of glasses are drunk by the sound of music!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Four or five young people, protected by a railing, are employed
the whole morning in filling, as fast as they can stoop down to the
brunnen to do so, the quantities of glasses, which, from hands in
all directions, are extending towards them; but so excessively hot is
the cauldron, that the greater proportion of these glasses were, I
observed, cracked by it, and several I saw fall to pieces when delivered
to their owners. Not wishing to appear eccentric, which,
in this amphibious picture any one is who walks about the parade
without a glass of scalding hot water in his hand, I purchased a
goblet, and the first dip it got cracked it from top to bottom.</p>

<p>In describing the taste of the mineral water of Wiesbaden, were
I to say, that, while drinking it, one hears in one&rsquo;s ears the cackling
of hens, and that one sees feathers flying before one&rsquo;s eyes, I should
certainly grossly exaggerate; but when I declare that it exactly
resembles very hot chicken broth, I only say what Dr. Granville
said, and what in fact everybody says, and must say, respecting it;
and certainly I do wonder why the common people should be at
the inconvenience of making bad soup, when they can get much
better from Nature&rsquo;s great stock-pot&mdash;the Koch-brunnen of
Wiesbaden. At all periods of the year, summer or winter, the
temperature of this broth remains the same, and when one reflects
that it has been bubbling out of the ground, and boiling over, in
the very same state, certainly from the time of the Romans, and
probably from the time of the flood, it is really astonishing to think
what a most wonderful apparatus there must exist below, what an
inexhaustible stock of provisions to ensure such an everlasting
supply of broth, always formed of exactly the same eight or ten ingredients&mdash;always
salted to exactly the same degree, and always
served up at exactly the same heat.</p>

<p>One would think that some of the particles in the recipe would
be exhausted; in short, to speak metaphorically, that the chickens
would at last be boiled to rags, or that the fire would go out for
want of coals; but the oftener one reflects on these sorts of subjects,
the oftener is the old-fashioned observation forced upon the mind,
that let a man go where he will, Omnipotence is never from his
view!</p>

<p>As leaning against one of the columns of the arcade under which
the band was playing, I stood with my medicine in my hand, gazing
upon the strange group of people, who with extended glasses were
crowding and huddling round the Koch-brunnen, each eagerly trying
to catch the eye of the young water-dippers, I could not help feeling,
as I had felt at Langen-Schwalbach, whether it could be possible
for any prescription to be equally beneficial to such differently
made patients. To repeat all the disorders which it is said most
especially to cure, would be very nearly to copy the sad list of ailments
to which our creaky frames are subject. The inhabitants of
Wiesbaden rant, the hotel-keepers rave, about the virtues of this
medicine. Stories are most gravely related of people crawling to
Wiesbaden and running home. In most of the great lodging-houses
crutches are triumphantly displayed, as having belonged to
people who left them behind.</p>

<p>It is good they say for the stomach&mdash;good for the skin&mdash;good
for ladies of all possible ages&mdash;for all sorts and conditions of men.
It lulls pain&mdash;therefore it is good, they say, for people going out of
this world, yet equally good is it, they declare, for those whose fond
parents earnestly wish them to come in. For a head-ache, drink,
the inn-keepers exclaim, at the Koch-brunnen! For gout in the
heels, soak the body, the doctors say, in the chicken-broth!&mdash;in
short, the valetudinarian, reclining in his carriage, has scarcely
entered the town than, say what he will of himself, the inhabitants
all seem to agree in repeating&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Benè, benè respondere; dignus
es entrare nostro docto corpore!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, there would be no end in stating what the Wiesbaden
water is said to be good for; a much simpler course is to explain,
that doctors do agree in saying that it is <i>not</i> good for complaints
where there is any disposition to inflammation or regular fever, and
that it changes consumption into&mdash;death.</p>

<p>By about seven o'clock, the vast concourse of people who had
visited the Koch-Brunnen had imbibed about as much of the medicine
as they could hold, and accordingly, like swallows, almost
simultaneously departing, the parade was deserted; the young
water-dippers had also retired to rest, and every feature in the picture
vanished, except the smoking, misty fumes of the water, which
now, no longer in request, boiled and bubbled by itself, as it
flowed into the drains, by which it eventually reached the Rhine.</p>

<p>The first act of the entertainment being thus over, in about a
quarter of an hour the second commenced; in short, so soon as the
visiters, retiring to their rooms, could divest or denude themselves
of their garments, I saw stalking down the long passage of my
lodging-house one heavy German gentleman after another whose
skull-cap, dressing-gown, and slippers, plainly indicated that he was
proceeding to the bath. In a short time, lady after lady, in similar
dishabille, was seen following the same course. Silence, gravity,
and incognito were the order of the day; and though I bowed as
usual in meeting these undressed people, yet the polite rule is, not,
as at other moments, to accompany the inclination with a gentle
smile, but to dilute it with a look which cannot be too solemn or
too sad.</p>

<p>There was something to my mind so very novel in bathing in
broth, that I resolved to try the experiment, particularly as it was
the only means I had of following the crowd. Accordingly, retiring
to my room, in a minute or two I also, in my slippers and black
dressing-gown, was to be seen, staff in hand, mournfully walking
down the long passage, as slowly and as gravely as if I had been in
such a procession all my life. An infirm elderly lady was just before
me&mdash;some lighter-sounding footsteps were behind me&mdash;but
without raising our eyes from the ground, we all moved on just as
if we had been corpses gliding or migrating from one churchyard
to another.</p>

<p>After descending a long well-staircase, I came to a door, which I
no sooner opened, than, of its own accord, it slammed after me
exactly as, five seconds before, it had closed upon the old lady who
had preceded me, and I now found myself in an immense building,
half filled with steam.</p>

<p>A narrow passage or aisle conducted me down the middle, on
each side of me there being a series of doors opening into the baths,
which, to my very great astonishment, I observed, were all open at
top, being separated from each other by merely a half-inch boarded
partition, not seven feet high!</p>

<p>Into several of these cells there was literally nothing but the
steam to prevent people in the houses of the opposite side of the
street from looking&mdash;a very tall man in one bath could hardly help
peeping into the next, and in the roof or loft above the ceiling
there were several loop-holes, through which any one might have
had a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the whole unfledged scene. The arrangement,
or rather want of arrangement, was altogether most astonishing;
and as I walked down the passage, my first exclamation to
myself was, &ldquo;Well, thank Heaven, this would not do in England!&rdquo;
To this remark the Germans would of course say, that low, half-inch
scantling is quite sufficient among well-bred people, whatever
coarser protection might be requisite among us English; but though
this argument may sound triumphant, yet delicacy is a subject which
is not fit for noisy discussion. Like the bloom on fruit, it is a subject
that does not bear touching; and if people of their own accord
do not feel that the scene I have described is indelicate, it is
quite impossible to prove it to them, and therefore &ldquo;the less said is
the soonest mended.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I was standing in the long passage, occupying myself with the
above reflections, a nice, healthy old woman, opening a door, beckoned
to me to advance, and accordingly with her I entered the
little cell. Seeing I was rather infirm, and a stranger, she gave
me, with two towels, a few necessary instructions,&mdash;such as that I
was to remain in the mixture about thirty-five minutes, and beneath
the fluid to strike with my arms and legs as strenuously as
possible.</p>

<p>The door was now closed, and my dressing-gown being carefully
hung upon a peg (a situation I much envied it), I proceeded,
considerably against my inclination, to introduce myself to my
new acquaintance, whose face, or surface, was certainly very revolting;
for a white, thick, dirty, greasy scum, exactly resembling
what would be on broth, covered the top of the bath. But all
this, they say, is exactly as it should be, and, indeed, German bathers
at Wiesbaden actually insist on its appearance, as it proves,
they argue, that the bath has not been used by any one else. In
most places, in ordering a warm bath, it is necessary to wait till the
water be heated, but at Wiesbaden the springs are so exceedingly
hot, that the baths are obliged to be filled over-night, in order to
be <i>cool</i> enough in the morning; and the dirty scum I have mentioned
is the required proof that the water has, during that time,
been undisturbed.</p>

<p>Resolving not to be bullied by the ugly face of my antagonist, I
entered my bath, and in a few seconds I lay horizontally, calmly
soaking, like my neighbours. Generally speaking, a dead silence
prevailed; occasionally an old man was heard to cough,&mdash;sometimes
a young woman was gently heard to sneeze,&mdash;and two or
three times there was a sudden heavy splash in the cell adjoining
mine, which proceeded from the leg of a great awkward German
Frau, kicking, by mistake, above, instead of (as I was vigorously
doing) beneath the fluid. Every sigh that escaped was heard, and
whenever a patient extricated him or herself from the mess, one
could hear puffing and rubbing as clearly as if one had been assisting
at the operation.</p>

<p>In the same mournful succession in which they had arrived, the
bathers, in due time, ascended, one after another, to their rooms,
where they were now permitted to eat&mdash;what they had certainly
well enough earned&mdash;their breakfast. As soon as mine was concluded,
I voted it necessary to clean my head, for from certain
white particles which float throughout the bath, as thickly as, and
indeed very much resembling, the mica in granite, I found that
my hair was in a sticky state, in which I did not feel disposed it
should remain. I ought, however, most explicitly to state, that the
operation I here imposed upon myself was an act of eccentricity,
forming no part of the regular system of the Wiesbaden bathers&mdash;indeed,
I should say that the art of cleaning the hair is not anywhere
much encouraged among Germans, who, perhaps with reason,
rather pride themselves in despising any sort of occupation or accomplishment
which can at all be called&mdash;superficial.</p>

<p>Before I quit the subject of bathing, I may as well at once observe,
that one of my principal reasons for selecting the apartments
I occupied at the Englischen Hof was, that the window of my sitting-room
looked into the horse-bath, which was immediately beneath
them. Three or four times a-day, horses, lame or chest-foundered,
were brought to this spot. As the water was hot, the
animals, on first being led into it, seemed much frightened, splashing,
and violently pawing with their fore-feet an if to cool it, but
being at last more accustomed to the strange sensation, they very
quickly seemed exceedingly to enjoy it. Their bodies being entirely
covered, the halter was then tied to a post, and they were
thus left to soak for half or three-quarters of an hour. The heat
seemed to heighten the circulation of their blood, and nothing could
look more animated than their heads, as, peeping out of the hot
fluid, they shook their dripping manes and snorted at every carriage,
and horse, which they heard passing.</p>

<p>The price paid for each bathing of each horse is eighteen
kreuzers, and this trifling fact always appeared to me to be the
most satisfactory proof I could meet with of the curative properties
of the Wiesbaden baths: for though it is, of course, the interest of
the inhabitants to insist on their efficacy, yet the poor peasant
would never, I think, continue for a fortnight to pay sixpence
a-day, unless he knew, by experience of some sort or other, that
his animal would really derive benefit.</p>

<p>One must not, however carry the moral too far; for even if it
be admitted that these baths cure in horses strains and other effects
of <i>over-work</i>, it does not follow that they are to be equally beneficial
in gout, and other human complaints, which we all know
are the effects of <i>under-work</i>, or want of exercise.</p>

<p>For more than half an hour I had been indolently watching this
amphibious scene, when the landlord entering my room said, that
the Russian Prince G&mdash;&mdash;n wished to speak to me on some business;
and the information was scarcely communicated, when I
perceived his Highness standing at the threshold of my door. With
the attention due to his rank, I instantly begged he would do me
the honour to walk in; and, after we had sufficiently bowed to
each other, and I had prevailed upon my guest to sit down, I
gravely requested him, as I stood before him, to be so good as to
state in what way I could have the good fortune to render him any
service. The Prince very briefly replied, that he had called upon
me, considering that I was the person in the hotel best capable (he
politely inclined his head) of informing him by what route it would
be most advisable for him to proceed to London, it being his wish
to visit my country.</p>

<p>In order at once to solve this very simple problem, I silently unfolded
and spread out upon the table my map of Europe; and each
of us, as we leant over it, placing a fore-finger on or near Wiesbaden&mdash;(our
eyes being fixed upon Dover)&mdash;we remained in this
reflecting attitude for some seconds, until the Prince&rsquo;s finger first
solemnly began to trace its route. In doing this I observed that
his Highness&rsquo;s hand kept swerving far into the Netherlands; so,
gently pulling it by the thumb towards Paris, I used as much force
as I thought decorous, to induce it to advance in a straight line;
however, finding my efforts ineffectual, I ventured, with respectful
astonishment, to ask, &ldquo;Why travel by so uninteresting a route?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Prince at once acknowledged that the road I had recommended
would, by visiting Paris, afford him the greatest pleasure,
but he frankly told me that no Russian, not even a personage of
his rank, could enter that capital without first obtaining a written
permission from the Emperor!!!</p>

<p>These words were no sooner uttered than I felt my fluent civility
suddenly begin to coagulate; the attention I paid my guest became
forced and unnatural&mdash;I was no longer at my ease; and though I
bowed, strained, and endeavoured to be, if possible, more respectful,
than ever, yet I really could hardly prevent my lips from muttering
aloud, that I had sooner die a homely English peasant than
live to be a Russian Prince! In short, his Highness&rsquo;s words acted
upon my mind like thunder upon beer; and, moreover, I could almost
have sworn that I was an old lean wolf, contemptuously observing
a bald ring rubbed by the collar from the neck of a sleek,
well-fed mastiff dog; however, recovering myself, I managed to
give as much information as it was in my humble power to afford,
and my noble guest then taking his departure, I returned to my
open window, to give vent in solitude (as I gazed upon the horse-bath)
to my own reflections upon the subject.</p>

<p>Although the petty rule of my life has been never to trouble myself
about what the world calls &ldquo;politics&rdquo;&mdash;(a fine word, by-the-by,
much easier expressed than understood)&mdash;yet, I must own, I am
always happy when I see a nation enjoying itself, and melancholy
when I observe any large body of people suffering pain or imprisonment.
But of all sorts of imprisonment, that of the mind is, to
my taste, the most cruel; and, therefore, when I consider over what
immense dominions the Emperor of Russia presides, and how he
governs, I cannot help sympathizing most sincerely with those innocent
sufferers who have the misfortune to be born his subjects;
for if a Russian Prince be not freely permitted to go to Paris, in
what a melancholy state of slavery and debasement must exist the
minds of what we call the lower classes?</p>

<p>As a sovereign remedy for this lamentable political disorder,
many very sensible people in England prescribe, I know, that we
ought to have recourse to arms. I must confess, however, it seems
to me that one of the greatest political errors England could commit
would be to declare, or to join in declaring war against Russia;
in short, that an appeal to brute force would, at this moment, be at
once most unscientifically to stop an immense moral engine, which,
if left to its work, is quite powerful enough, without bloodshed, to
gain for humanity, at no expense at all, its object. The individual
who is, I conceive to overthrow the Emperor of Russia&mdash;who is to
direct his own legions against himself&mdash;who is to do what Napoleon
at the head of his Great Army failed to effect, is the little child,
who, lighted by the single wick of a small lamp, sits at this moment
perched above the great steam-press of our &ldquo;Penny Magazine,&rdquo;
feeding it, from morning till night, with blank paper, which, at almost
every pulsation of the engine, comes out stamped on both sides
with engravings, and with pages of plain, useful, harmless knowledge,
which, by making the lower orders acquainted with foreign
lands&mdash;foreign production&rsquo;s&mdash;various states of society, &amp;c., tend
practically to inculcate &ldquo;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
peace&mdash;good will towards men.&rdquo; It has already been stated, that
what proceeds from this press is now greedily devoured by the
people of Europe; indeed, even at Berlin, we know it can hardly
be reprinted fast enough.</p>

<p>This child, then,&mdash;&ldquo;this sweet little cherub that sits up, aloft,&rdquo;
is the only army that an enlightened country like ours should, I
humbly think, deign to oppose to one who reigns in darkness&mdash;who
trembles at day-light, and whose throne rests upon ignorance and
despotism. Compare this mild, peaceful, intellectual policy, with
the dreadful, savage alternative of going to war, and the difference
must surely be evident to every one. In the former case, we calmly
enjoy, first of all, the pleasing reflection, that our country is generously
imparting to the nations of Europe the blessings she is tranquilly
deriving from the purification and civilization of her own
mind;&mdash;far from wishing to exterminate, we are gradually illuminating,
the Russian peasant&mdash;we are mildly throwing a gleam of
light upon the fetters of the Russian Prince; and surely every
well-disposed person must see, that, if we will only have patience,
the result of this noble, temperate conduct must produce all that
reasonable beings can desire. But, on the other hand, if we appeal
to arms&mdash;if, losing our temper and our head, we endeavour
(as the bear is taught to dance) to civilize the Emperor of Russia
by hard blows, we instantly consolidate all the tottering elements
of his dominions; we give life, energy, and loyalty to his army; we
avert the thoughts of his princes from their own dishonour; we
inflame the passions, instead of awakening the sober judgment of
his subjects, and thus throwing away both our fulcrum and our
lever, by resorting to main strength, we raise the savage not only
to a level with ourselves, but actually make ourselves decidedly
his inferior; for Napoleon&rsquo;s history ought surely sufficiently to instruct
us, that the weapons of this northern Prince of Darkness&mdash;(his
climate and his legions)&mdash;even if we had an army, we ought
not, in prudence, to attack; but the fact is, our pacific policy has
been to try to exist without an army,&mdash;in the opinion of all military
men we have even disarmed ourselves too much, and, in this
situation, suddenly to change our system, and without arms or
armour to attack one who is almost invulnerable, would be most
irrationally to paralyze our own political machinery.</p>

<p>If, by its moral assistance, we wisely intend, under the blessings
of Heaven, to govern and be governed, we surely ought not from
anger to desert, its standard; and, on the other hand, it must be
equally evident that before we determine on civilizing the Emperor
of Russia, by trying the barbarous experiment of whether his troops
or ours can, without shrinking, eat most lead, it would be prudent
to create an army, as well as funds able to maintain it; for&mdash;</p>

<p>Being desirous to observe the way in which a Sunday evening
was passed in Germany, at seven o'clock on that day I followed a
crowd of people into the theatre, and found the house so full, that
I had great difficulty in obtaining a seat. The performance was a
complete surprise to me; for though ages ago, when I was young, I
had been in the habit of regularly attending for years together an
Italian theatre, yet never having before witnessed a German opera,
I did not know it was possible so completely to adapt the sounds of
music to every varying thought and sentiment in a play; in short,
the words of the play, and the notes of the orchestra, were as
nearly as possible fac-similes of each other; demi-semi-quavers,
crotchets, and minims being made most ingeniously to mimic, not
only exclamations, but marks of admiration, notes of interrogation,
colons, and full stops.</p>

<p>The musical emphasis which accompanied every line throughout
the piece, while it merely astonished me, seemed to be most scientifically
appreciated by the audience, whose countenances of severe
attention were very remarkable; no interruption, however, of any
sort took place, their feelings of approbation or censure being
equally mute. In the various departments of the performance, a
great deal of natural talent was displayed, and whether one attended
to the music&mdash;to the style of acting&mdash;to the scenery&mdash;or even to a
dish of devils, which made their appearance, most strangely
garnished with toads, bats, serpents, and non-descript beings, one
could not help admitting that, in spite of its torpor, there must exist
a considerable quantity of latent genius, imagination, and taste, in
the audience itself; indeed, there can be no fairer criterion of the
mental character of any country, than its own national spectacles,
which are of course, and must be, made to correspond with, and
suit, the palates of those who support them. It is true that that
mimic Fashion will occasionally introduce into a country foreign
habits, not suited to its climate. For instance, of our own fine
London opera, Italians say, that without calling upon the English
audience itself to sing, their behaviour quite clearly proves that they
have no real taste for&mdash;that they are not capable of relishing, the
foreign musical luxury which by the power of money they have
purchased: in short, they accuse us of listening, when we ought to
be coughing&mdash;of talking to each other, when we ought to be breathless,
from attention&mdash;and of most barbarously throwing the light of
the theatre upon ourselves instead of on the performers&mdash;thus
showing that we prefer looking at tiers of red cheeks and rows of
white teeth, to listening to the soft, simple melody of music. But,
whether these foreign remarks respecting an Italian performance
be true or not, in our own element, in our own English theatres,
the accusation of want of taste does not hold good. The admirers
of Shakspeare, Siddons, Kemble, Kean, O'Neil, &amp;c., cannot complain
that the writings of the one, or the acting of the others, have
not reached the hearts of those to whom they have been directed;
in short, without sympathetic talent throughout the country, those
names could never have reached the respective eminences on
which they stand, and thus, though they do honour to the country,
the country can also claim honour from them.</p>

<p>When the pleasing performance I had been witnessing was at an
end, on coming into the open air, I found it was raining. Like
myself, most people were without umbrellas; the rain, however,
seemed to have no effect upon the tide of human bodies that flowed
<i>en masse</i> towards the Cursaal, which, ready lighted up, was waiting
for the disgorging of the theatre. On entering the great door,
each person was required to pay a florin, and as the large room
was rapidly very nearly filled, the band struck up, and dancing
most vigorously began. I could now scarcely believe my eyes, that
the performers, so awkwardly attempting to be active before me,
were the identical people whose passive good taste and genius I
had, with so much pleasure, been admiring; for with a more awkward,
clumsy, inelegant set of dancers I certainly never before had
found myself in society. Not only was the execution of their steps
violently bad, but their whole style of dancing was of a texture as
coarse as dowlas, and most especially, in their mode of waltzing,
there was a repetition of vulgar jerks which it was painfully disagreeable
to witness. Leaving, therefore, these dull, heavy, tetotums
to spin out the evening in their own way, I quitted the great
room; but no sooner did I enter the smaller dens than I found that
I had fallen from the frying-pan into the fire, for these &ldquo;hells&rdquo; were
literally swarming with inhabitants. In each chamber an immense
solitary lamp (having a circular reflector) hung over the green
cloth table, round which, male and female gamesters, of all ages,
were bending, with horrid features of anxiety; and as the powerful
rancid oil light shone upon their ill-favoured countenances, I could
not help with abhorrence leaning backwards, at seeing a group of
fellow-creatures huddled together for such a base, low-minded object.
In passing through the chambers of this infernal region, I
found one worse, if possible, than the other. Under each lamp,
there were, here and there, contrasted with young nibblers, individual
countenances of habitual gamesters, which, as objects of detestation,
many a painter, or rather scene-painter, would have been
exceedingly anxious to sketch; but I was so completely disgusted
with the whole thing, that, as quickly as my staff and two legs could
carry me, swinging the other arm, I took my departure.</p>

<p>In hastily worming my way through the ball-room, I saw there
no reason for changing my opinion; and when I got into the fresh,
cool, open air, though I was fully sensible I had not spent my Sunday
evening exactly as I ought to have done, yet, in the course of
my very long life, I think I never felt more practically disposed to
repeat, as in England we are, thank Heaven, still taught to do&mdash;</p>
